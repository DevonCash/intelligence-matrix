who can be sent on missions in lieu of the players.
This squad (p. 106) has a collective score of 0 in
FRC, TAC, CRE, and RFX. This upgrade can be taken
again to increase any squad attribute by 1, or to add
a new squad. Squads can also be brought along on
player missions as referee-controlled NPCs. When
the players send a backup squad on a mission,
the referee should choose an attribute score to
represent the mission (e.g. FRC for wiping out an
enemy group, RFX for stealth infilitration) and roll for
the squad's performance:
  - **TWO 1s:** The squad dies or (1-in-1D6) defects.
  - **FAILURE:** The mission consequence plays out.
  - **PARTIAL:** Mission complete, but no reward.
  - **SUCCESS:** As above, but players get the reward.
  - **TWO 6s**: As above, plus +1 to any squad attribute.
`,`**DEFENSE:** FIST installs new security measures, such
as squads of guards, hazards, or traps. For each
DEFENSE upgrade installed, FIST may instantly kill
one enemy near the upgrade during base invasions.
`,`**EXPERT:** FIST hires an on-site expert who can provide
the team with additional items before the mission
begins. Experts in different fields offer different
items: a weaponsmith may present the team with
weapon tags, a scientist may create new chemical
compounds, and a doctor may provide medical
supplies. FIST can get one randomized item per
expert per mission, or request a specific item and
wait until the next mission begins to receive it.
`,`**OFFENSE:** FIST acquires a weapon of mass destruction
which can be used against a chosen target once per
mission. Various weapon types are possible, but it
should be something dangerous, like a bomber plane,
orbital laser, or powerful ancient relic. FIST is also
subject to this weapon and so must clear the area
before its use, or risk being hurt as well. The weapon
deals 3D6 DAMAGE by default, and taking OFFENSE
again increases the DAMAGE by 1D6.
`,`**STORAGE:** FIST builds a warehouse or hangar which
can be used to safely store vehicles, hide fugitives,
and contain anomalies without being detected.
`,`**SUPPORT:** FIST gains a \u201Cman-in-the-chair" style
support agent who can contact them throughout
their missions via radio. This support agent will
reveal information the players would not usually be
able to access when asked, according to their area
of expertise: a weapons expert can divulge enemy
DAMAGE ratings, a tactician can describe boss
moves before they happen, etc. Support agents can
answer 1D6 questions per mission.

You
may identify inconsistencies in ledgers without rolling the dice, and you
can always spot a counterfeit bill. Once per mission, you may ask the
referee where and how a given entity is spending its money, and receive
an honest answer (including offshore accounts, tax write-offs, and
employee embezzlement). If you notice and correct an inconsistency
in your FIST game, like lost HP that was never marked or a WAR DIE
someone forgot they had, gain a WAR DIE.

  - Coffee thermos (+1D6 HP, one use), -2 CREATIVE
`,`**ACE:** You can do tricky vehicular maneuvers, like drifting or doing a
barrel roll, without rolling the dice. If it\u2019s something really difficult, like
flying sideways through a small opening or riding a motorcycle across
a tightrope, you can do it, but a key component of your vehicle will be
destroyed\u2014the referee will tell you what. When you have downtime to
repair it, you can use it again.

  - Fuzzy dice (gives any vehicle +2 MAX HP), +1 REFLEXIVE
`,`**ACHILLES:** In exchange for great power, you have a terrible weakness
to a common substance, such as salt, iron, or silver. It could also be
something considered uncommon (like a specific mineral from space),
but the referee will make sure it appears often enough to be a problem. If
this substance physically touches you, you are completely incapacitated
until you have downtime to receive medical care.

  - Substance detector (pings on proximity), +6 MAX HP
`,`**AIMBOT:** You can only attack one target at a time. You are unable to
engage another until your target has either left your line of fire or died.
While attacking your target, partial successes become full ones.

  - Hand cannon (1D6+1 DAMAGE), -1 TACTICAL
`,`**AKIMBO:** You can wield any two weapons at once, but your accuracy is
decreased: when an attack lands, roll DAMAGE for both weapons, then
drop one die from the total.

  - Two SMGs (1D6 DAMAGE each), +1 FORCEFUL
`,`**AMATEUR:** You have no formalized military training. Civilians always listen
to you and tend to trust you, but you can never pass as a soldier.

  - Civilian outfit (0 ARMOR, blend into crowds), -1 FORCEFUL
`,`**ANALYST:** You are trained in the art of war, and your judgment in the
field of combat analysis is impeccable. When a fight breaks out, you
may always ask the referee for any nearby exits, as well as what tactics
your enemies plan to use (e.g. flanking, a bum rush, or picking off the
weak), and receive an honest answer.

  - Bolt-action rifle (1D6+1 DAMAGE), +2 TACTICAL
`,`**ANIMUS:** Your touch grants sapience. Once per mission, you may touch
an object or animal to give it human intelligence, movement and speech.
Those you \u201Cawaken\u201D in this way are under no obligation to take it well.

  - Lighter (your longtime companion), +1 CREATIVE
`,`**AQUATIC:** You\u2019re a water-breather\u2014perhaps due to spliced-on fish genes
or cybernetic gills\u2014and you may stay submerged indefinitely with no ill
effects. When you roll the dice to do something risky underwater, roll
3D6 and take the best two. On land, roll 3D6 and take the worst two.

  - Heavy harpoon launcher (1D6+2 DAMAGE), +1 FORCEFUL
`,`**ARMORED:** You are fused with a cumbersome suit of power armor that
you cannot remove. Once per mission, you can completely ignore any
amount of DAMAGE dealt to you.

  - Power armor (2 ARMOR, cannot be unequipped), -2 REFLEXIVE
`,`**ARTIST:** If you have a reasonable amount of time and complete safety,
you can create something with your art supplies and it will become real
until the end of the mission.

  - Art supplies (one use), +2 CREATIVE
`,`**ASSASSINATION:** Once per mission, you may instantly kill up to three weak
enemies (3 HP or less) who are completely unaware of your presence,
without rolling the dice. If you do not have a way of measuring an
enemy\u2019s HP, you may have to gauge their condition based upon referee
description.

  - Wrist blade (3 DAMAGE, does not count as equipped), +1 REFLEXIVE
`,`**ASTRONAUT:** You have been to (or are from) outer space. When you would
roll the dice to do something risky which involves aliens, spaceships,
airless environments, or irregular gravity, roll 3D6 and take the best two.

  - Space suit (1 ARMOR, constant oxygen supply), -1 REFLEXIVE
`,`**ATMOKINESIS:** You can always change the weather within a mile of
you. Once per mission, you can make it something particularly severe/
dangerous (tornadoes, extreme heat, freezing blizzards, etc.) Once
changed, it\u2019s difficult to undo.

  - Lightning grenade (1D6 DAMAGE, one use), -1 TACTICAL
`,`**AURA:** You can perceive the auras of yourself and others; their qualities
are up to your interpretation. You may also regulate and amplify
your aura to conduct it between bodies\u2014while doing so, NPCs who
are touching you won\u2019t CHOKE, and anyone who remains in constant
physical contact with you for about ten minutes regains 1D6 HP.

  - Psionic grenade (scrambles emotions, one use), +1 FORCEFUL
`,`**BERSERKER:** For you, there are no tactics\u2014only the thrill of battle. If you
rush into combat with no precaution or pre-planning, your first attack
will deal double DAMAGE.

  - Minigun (1D6+2 DAMAGE), -2 TACTICAL
`,`**BOMBER:** If you have a reasonable amount of prep time, you can use
your bomb kit and attempt to destroy any structure by rolling +TACTICAL.
You may also spend a WAR DIE at any time to create a small, throwable
explosive that deals 1D6 DAMAGE.

  - Bomb kit (one use), +1 TACTICAL\\
`,`**BOTTLENECK:** If you put yourself between something you are defending
and a large amount of enemies, you deal +1 DAMAGE per 5 enemies
attempting to harm you for as long as you hold your position. You may
sacrifice yourself to ensure that an oncoming horde does not pass.

  - Antique shortsword (1D6+1 DAMAGE), -1 TACTICAL
`,`**BOUNCE:** When you deal damage to an enemy in melee combat, they are
tossed 1D6 \xD7 10 feet with enough force to knock them clear through a
wall (though this deals no additional DAMAGE).

  - Kinetic gauntlet (1D6 DAMAGE), +1 FORCEFUL
`,`**BREAKDOWN:** A directive burns in the back of your mind. When you
take this trait, randomly roll a CHOKE score for your character (D66, p.
148)\u2014and roll against it when appropriate, as the ref would with an NPC.
If you CHOKE, you must either perform the listed action immediately or
release a psionic shockwave from your skull, ten feet in diameter with
the concussive force of a frag grenade. This shockwave deals 1D6+2
DAMAGE to everyone caught inside (not including yourself) and, if you
spend a WAR DIE, additionally functions as a short-range EMP burst
which shorts out power lines, burns out lights, and disables electronics.

  - Needle gun (1D6+1 DAMAGE), -1 TACTICAL
`,`**BUDDY:** You and another player who possesses the BUDDY trait are best
friends. When you work together, you become an unstoppable force of
nature, adding +1 whenever you apply a WAR DIE to your buddy\u2019s roll. If
your buddy dies, your MAX HP is halved by grief (rounded down) until
you dedicate a mission to delivering a special possession, such as their
gun, their dog tags, or their favorite book, to a proper final resting place.

  - Friendship bracelet (matches another), +2 FORCEFUL
`,`**BUILDER:** Given enough time, the right materials, and relative safety,
you can build any common structure (guaranteed to be sound, sturdy,
and reliable) without rolling the dice. You build things simple, solid, and
square, so special structures and rush jobs will have complications\u2014the
referee will tell you what.

  - Tool belt (produce any hardware store tool, one use), -1 CREATIVE
`,`**BUM:** Years of homelessness have been harsh on your bones, but you
are skilled in the art of survival sans income and shelter. You may roll
the dice +CREATIVE to panhandle in the presence of enemies\u2014on a
success, at least one enemy will give you something they have, free of
charge. Those who ignore poor and homeless people will never notice
you, even if you\u2019re hiding in plain sight.

  - Shabby coat (new Item (p. 85) in pocket each mission), -1 FORCEFUL
`,`**CAMOUFLAGE:** You have an impressive collection of face paints and
situationally-appropriate patterned fatigues, and you know how to use
them. When you begin a mission, describe your current camo pattern,
such as \u201Cdesert,\u201D \u201Cforest,\u201D \u201Cjungle,\u201D or \u201Curban.\u201D Take +1 to your roll
whenever you roll to avoid detection in the corresponding environment.

  - Camouflage fatigues (multiple patterns), +2 REFLEXIVE
`,`**CANNIBAL:** Your power grows when you feast upon human flesh. When
you have privacy, you may dine upon any corpse and gain 1D6 HP. If you
imply to someone that you're going to eat them, roll 1D6\u2014if the result
is less than or equal to the amount of people you've eaten during this
mission, they lose their nerve and capitulate or flee (referee's choice).

  - Chainsaw (1D6+1 DAMAGE), -2 CREATIVE
`,`**CENTIPEDE:** You have a worm-like parasite living inside you. You may
roll +FORCEFUL to bite someone. On a success, the parasite travels
through your mouth and latches on, controlling their body. The parasite
may then travel through the secondary body, and so on, creating a
\u201Cchain\u201D of bodies. For each body you add to the chain, gain their HP
and any special abilities they have, but take a cumulative -1 penalty to
REFLEXIVE. You may release a body from the end of the chain at any
time; they quickly regain control.

  - Muzzle (contains the centipede, accessory), +1 FORCEFUL
`,`**CHAMPION:** You live for the righteous thrill of triumph. When you are the
only one to survive a fight, immediately gain 2D6 MAX HP and fully heal.

  - Spear (1D6+1 DAMAGE), +1 FORCEFUL
`,`**CHARM:** You can always manipulate people into doing what you want
without rolling the dice, but you will have to make a significant sacrifice
or maintain a difficult lie\u2014the referee will tell you how.

  - Combat tuxedo (1 ARMOR), +1 CREATIVE
`,`**CHEF:** You can cook a good meal in almost any situation without rolling
the dice. When you need to cook an exquisite meal, roll +CREATIVE and
choose one of the following effects on a partial success, or two on a
full success: grants +1 to any attribute for one roll, heals 1D6+CRE HP,
pacifies and nourishes those who eat it.

  - Meat cleaver (1D6 DAMAGE), +1 WAR DIE per mission
`,`**CHEMIST:** If you have a reasonable amount of prep time and complete
safety, you can set up your portable lab and synthesize any common
chemical, such as isopropyl alcohol, lighter fluid, or chloroform.
Synthesizing esoteric or experimental compounds will require special
supplies\u2014the referee will tell you what.

  - Portable lab (three uses), +1 TACTICAL
`,`**CLASSY:** You are well-versed in the aesthetics, logistics, and mores of
high society. Your name always ends up on VIP lists, and rich socialites
tend to share gossip with you freely. Lower-class people will never trust
you, and you struggle to hide the sticky psychic stench of wealth.

  - Diamond jewelry (quietly bribe someone, one use), +1 CREATIVE
`,`**CLIMBER:** You can climb surfaces with hand- and footholds without
rolling the dice, and stick to smooth surfaces by rolling +REFLEXIVE. If
you do so during a dangerous situation, you must roll +REFLEXIVE again
to unstick yourself without falling or getting hurt.

  - Grapple gun (50 feet of cable), +1 REFLEXIVE
`,`**COMMANDO:** You're a real life action hero. You deal +1 DAMAGE during
any solo fight where you are clearly outmatched, but take a -2 DAMAGE
penalty when someone is fighting alongside you.

  - Rocket launcher (1D6+2 DAMAGE), +1 FORCEFUL
`,`**CONCEAL:** You can always take weapons and contraband through pat-
downs, checkpoints, and metal detectors without rolling the dice. Once
per mission, if you have no weapon equipped and no weapons in your
inventory, you may reveal a random weapon (roll D66 on the weapons
table, p. 83) and say that you had it hidden away the whole time.

  - Leather trenchcoat (1 ARMOR), -1 REFLEXIVE
`,`**CONTORTIONIST:** You can always fit through small openings and perform
feats of flexibility without rolling the dice. If you contort yourself in
a particularly difficult way, you've pulled something\u2014decrease your
REFLEXIVE attribute by 2 until the end of the mission.

  - Skin-tight suit (1 ARMOR), +1 REFLEXIVE
`,`**CRUEL:** Merely shooting, burning, or stabbing someone is never enough
for you\u2014without fail, you always double down and twist the knife. While
dealing DAMAGE, you may reroll any dice which show up as 1.

  - Micro-blade stiletto (1D6+RFX DAMAGE), +1 DAMAGE vs. fleeing targets
`,`**CUT:** You can easily cut any mundane object (such as a tree, a dumpster,
or an oil tanker) into several pieces given enough time. You may also
instantly cut something perfectly in half, as long as you identify its
unique fracture point by rolling 1D6 and correctly predicting the result.
When someone damages you, and you're wielding a cutting weapon,
you may roll DAMAGE to counter theirs. On a mismatch, they hurt you
as usual and your damage roll means nothing, but on a tie, you are
unscathed... and your opponent is revealed to have been cut in half.

  - Katana (1D6+1 DAMAGE), +1 REFLEXIVE
`,`**CYBORG:** You have augmented ultrahuman agility. You can reroll one
damage die\u2014dealing or receiving\u2014once per fight.

  - Cyborg exoskeleton (1 ARMOR), +1 REFLEXIVE
`,`**DEBATEUR:** If you change an NPC\u2019s mind or convincingly win an argument
against them, you may immediately deal 6 DAMAGE to them (ignoring
armor) in a psychic attack.

  - Debate notes (use to cite inarguable statistics, one use), +1 TACTICAL
`,`**DEFUSE:** When you would attempt to defuse a bomb or bomb-like
device, you may open it up to reveal a mess of wires. Ask the referee to
roll 1D6 and choose an amount of wire colors equal to the number rolled
(the ref should choose from the following list: red, orange, yellow, green,
blue, purple). The referee should secretly decide which wire, when cut,
defuses the bomb, assuming that all others will detonate it. You may roll
1D6 to receive a list of that many wire colors which are unsafe to cut. If
you roll equal to or over the amount of wire colors, you have no idea.

  - Wire cutters (3 DAMAGE), +1 REFLEXIVE
`,`**DETECTIVE:** At the beginning of each mission, the referee will privately
tell you a secret, such as the identity of a killer or the truth behind a
conspiracy. Every time you do something which produces conclusive,
show-stopping evidence towards revealing the secret, gain a WAR DIE.

  - Notepad (provides details about someone, three uses), +1 TACTICAL
`,`**DETONATOR:** You can explode, once. Doing so kills you, messily, destroys
nearby structures, and deals 2D6 DAMAGE to everyone around you.

  - Bomb suit (2 ARMOR), +1 FORCEFUL
`,`**DIRECTOR:** Once per mission, you may firmly announce, \u201CCUT!" The camera
pulls back, revealing a set, and you may give direction to the other
characters and NPCs as if they were actors in a movie. When ready to
play again, say \u201CACTION!\u201D and start again from the beginning of the
scene or fight (essentially rewinding time, allowing characters to make
different decisions and rolls).

  - Stupid hat, +1 CREATIVE
`,`**DIRTY:** You fight using underhanded and dishonorable methods. When
you trick-attack an enemy, roll DAMAGE twice and take the higher result.

  - Pocket sand (+1 to attack rolls vs. sand victim, one use), +1 FORCEFUL
`,`**DISGUISE:** You can disguise yourself as anyone as long as you have a
reasonable amount of prep time; however, your cover will be blown if
you either speak, move quickly, or get hurt\u2014the referee decides which.

  - Bulletproof vest (1 ARMOR), +1 TACTICAL
`,`**DOORS:** When you enter through a door, you may emerge through any
other door you have encountered. You have a method for pushing
through locked/barricaded doors (like lockpicks, bombs, or a heavy
boot) that works every time, but always has an inconvenient downside\u2014
the referee will tell you what.

  - Keyring (3 DAMAGE), +1 FORCEFUL
`,`**DRUID:** You are a philosopher of science and prophecy. If an eligible
sacrifice is at hand, you may observe the trajectory and resulting
patterns of its spilled blood for a simple yes-or-no answer to any
question, however complicated.

  - Psychoactive herb (cures a psionic ailment, one use), +1 TACTICAL
`,`**DUELIST:** You deal +1 DAMAGE during a fair fight with a single opponent.
You deal another +1 DAMAGE if you attempt to intimidate, taunt, or
seduce that opponent.

  - Laser katana (1D6+2 DAMAGE), +1 DAMAGE with melee weapons
`,`**ECHO:** You can create 1D6 shadow-clones of yourself at will. Doing so
stretches you thin, and costs you HP equal to the amount summoned.
The clones appear incorporeal, but can physically affect the world as you
can. Each clone has MAX HP equal to your MAX HP minus the number of
clones, does not think or feel, and behaves roughly as you behave.

  - Quantum duplicator (copies any object, one use), +2 MAX HP
`,`**EMPATHY:** You can sense how anyone is feeling without rolling the dice.
Whenever you do something risky to prevent needless pain and death,
roll 3D6 and take the best two. Any time you do something violent or
harmful, roll 3D6 and take the worst two.

  - Invisibility cloak (room for two people), -1 FORCEFUL
`,`**EXPERT:** Your encyclopedic knowledge of a scientific discipline exceeds
professional and borders on obsessive. When you take this trait, choose
an \u201C-ology,\u201D such as sociology, entomology, or cryptozoology. When you
roll the dice to do something risky related to your field of expertise, roll
3D6 and take the best two.

  - Textbook (answer any field-related question, one use), -1 CREATIVE
`,`**FASHIONABLE:** You may combine multiple pieces of body-sized armor
and wear them all at once to gain their cumulative ARMOR score, if you
can convincingly explain how they work together as a cohesive outfit.

  - Leather jacket (1 ARMOR), -2 REFLEXIVE
`,`**FATALITY:** Once per mission, you may describe the creative and brutal
finishing move you perform on an enemy with less than 3 HP (if you do
not have a way of measuring an enemy\u2019s HP, you may have to gauge
their condition based upon referee description). Once you\u2019ve performed
your finisher, the enemy is permanently killed and cannot be revived by
any means.

  - Kunai chain (1D6 DAMAGE), -1 TACTICAL
`,`**FATE:** You are able to manipulate the threads of chance, perhaps through
careful study of reality\u2019s emergent properties or by some connection
to the divine. When you would roll a WAR DIE, roll two instead and use
either one as your result. If you roll doubles, use both.

  - Loaded dice (difficult to detect), -2 TACTICAL
`,`**FIELD:** Once per mission, you may project a bubble of solid psionic force
ten feet in diameter which is centered on you and provides anyone
inside 3 ARMOR against outside attacks. If you roll the dice +CREATIVE,
you may attempt to fashion the field into a different shape. Failing this
roll or getting hurt while projecting the field immediately dissipates it.

  - Paint gun (clearly marks a surface or area), +2 FORCEFUL
`,`**FIEND:** You utilize amphetamines to enhance your focus. When you have
a second free, you can pop some pills and take +2 to your next TACTICAL
roll.

  - Pill bottle (one use), +1 WAR DIE per mission
`,`**FIGHTER:** Your study of hand-to-hand, the basis of all combat, has
made your body itself into a lethal weapon. You may choose to deal 1D6
DAMAGE when attacking with no weapon equipped. Once per mission,
you may launch a special, unarmed super attack which deals 1D6+2
DAMAGE and knocks most living things unconscious. When you do,
state the name of your super attack.

  - Flashy outfit (1 ARMOR), +1 FORCEFUL
`,`**FIREFIGHTER:** You are professionally trained to fight fires (or you are a
seasoned volunteer). Once per mission, you may entirely put out any
fire which has spread no further than the confines of a single structure
(particularly large or nasty fires may keep you occupied for a while). Add
+2 whenever you roll the dice to do something risky while navigating a
burning or collapsing environment.

  - Hydro-gun with backpack tank (3 DAMAGE, 55 gal.), -1 REFLEXIVE
`,`**FLIGHT:** You have the ability to fly, perhaps using wings, a jetpack, or
telekinetic levitation. If you take damage while in the air, you must roll
+REFLEXIVE to avoid a dangerous fall or collision with something nearby.

  - AR goggles (let you see enemies\u2019 HP), +1 TACTICAL
`,`**FLOW:** You live in the moment and can be like water, moving with the
currents of reality. Whenever you roll a failure, mark down a plus sign\u2014
you can have up to three. When you do something risky, you can spend
any amount of plus signs to add that much to your roll.

  - Staff (1D6 DAMAGE, 3-in-1D6 chance to knockout), -2 TACTICAL
`,`**FLURRY:** Once per mission, you may enter a \u201Cflurry state\u201D during combat.
In your flurry state, you may choose to instantly roll DAMAGE against
anyone who hurts you; doing so ends the state. When you leave your
flurry state, take 1D6 DAMAGE from overexertion.

  - Energy drink (+1D6 HP, one use), +2 REFLEXIVE
`,`**FOCUS:** When you have a moment of utter tranquility to rest and digest
the day\u2019s events (like a drink at an empty bar or a gorgeous view), gain
a WAR DIE. You lose this WAR DIE if you fail to use it during this mission.

  - Stress ball (squeeze for +1 to any WAR DIE roll), -1 CREATIVE
`,`**FORAGE:** When you have some prep time, you can ask the referee about
the local flora and fauna. If you present a convincing reason why one of
these things could work for the ailment you\u2019re trying to treat, you may
heal yourself or someone else for 1D6 HP.

  - Machete (1D6 DAMAGE), +1 TACTICAL
`,`**FREEZE:** Once per mission, you may freeze time for ten minutes and move
around freely. You may not harm or otherwise alter any living things (as
this would cause a superposition-collapse cascade), but you can do
anything else that fits in the span of ten minutes, such as constructing
a barricade, moving to a different location, or taking a short rest. To
outside observers, you will look like a blur, and your actions will appear
to have happened almost instantly. Your stasis grenade creates a zone
of frozen time ten feet in diameter which stops anything that enters it.

  - Stasis grenade (ten minute duration, one use), -1 TACTICAL
`,`**GADGETS:** You always carry a treasure trove of bulky, delicate electronics.
If you have space to work, you can use your electronics kit to create a
device (equivalent in function to a trait-granted item of your choice), or
a robot (has a trait of your choice, 1 HP, and 1 ARMOR).

  - Electronics kit (three uses), -2 REFLEXIVE
`,`**GANGSTER:** You are part of an organized crime group such as a mafia
syndicate, a yakuza clan, a cartel, or a triad. The referee will always
tell you where to find illegal items. You can intimidate enemies without
rolling, but cops and law-abiding civilians will always mistrust you.

  - Silencer (attach to any gun), +1 FORCEFUL
`,`**GENIUS:** You\u2019re really smart. You have to make sure everyone else knows
it. Whenever you correct someone, especially on something pedantic
(and you\u2019re actually right), heal 1 HP.

  - Glasses (you can\u2019t see without them), +2 TACTICAL
`,`**GOONS:** You begin each mission accompanied by 1D6 disposable goons.
Each goon comes with 3 MAX HP and all standard issue items. You
can roll +TACTICAL to command your goons. They tend to misinterpret
commands, shoot themselves in the foot (figuratively or literally), and
often make bizarre non-sequitur decisions under pressure.

  - Walkie-talkie (summons goons to your position), +1 TACTICAL
`,`**GROUND:** You know how to cut through the noise, for better or for worse.
Once per mission, you may plant yourself firmly and beckon your team
to \u201Cform up\u201D on you. If they do, mark the occasion with a firm gesture
(like pointing forward or reloading your shotgun), and choose a bonus
to activate for the next ten minutes: everyone in the area adds +2 to
their DAMAGE dealt and adds +2 when rolling to do something risky, or
all anomalous abilities and phenomena in the area are nullified.

  - Pump-action shotgun (1D6+1 DAMAGE), -1 CREATIVE
`,`**GROW:** You may double your size at will, as long as your spatial manipulator
belt is intact. Each time you do, increase your MAX HP by 1D6 (and gain
that much HP), increase your FORCEFUL score by 1, and decrease your
REFLEXIVE score by 1. While enlarged, you may also add your current HP
to any unarmed or melee DAMAGE you deal.

  - Spatial manipulator belt (accessory), -2 MAX HP
`,`**HACKER:** If you have a reasonable amount of prep time and direct access,
you can attempt to gain control of any computer or electronic machine
by rolling the dice +TACTICAL. If you do not have direct access, you can
attempt to hack in from a safe place using your briefcase computer.

  - Briefcase computer (remotely access electronics), +1 TACTICAL
`,`**HAPPY:** You don\u2019t let anything get you down. You have +1 on all rolls
to make a person or situation happier (but not necessarily better). If
you ask the referee \u201CWhat does this character enjoy?\u201D, they will always
answer truthfully.

  - Bundle of lollipops (heal 1 HP, three uses), -1 FORCEFUL
`,`**HARVEST:** When you would deal a killing blow with a melee weapon, you
may roll 1D6 to attempt to harvest an internal organ before death\u2014on a
4 or above, consume it, and choose to a) gain a WAR DIE, or b) heal for
1D6 HP. On a 3 or below, your killing blow doesn\u2019t land.

  - Bloody axe (1D6 DAMAGE), +1 REFLEXIVE
`,`**HATE:** Something about you just rubs people the wrong way, and you
don\u2019t mind that at all. When you meet someone, roll +CREATIVE\u2014on
anything but a success, they hate or strongly dislike you. When you
attack someone because you truly hate them\u2014not just for money, or
because they were a threat, but because you hate them, and you can
explain why\u2014they will be absolutely obliterated, HP notwithstanding.

  - Bubblegum (funny comic included), -1 CREATIVE
`,`**HAZARD:** You are unusually hardy when faced with toxins and pathogens.
Once per mission, you may expose yourself to a hazardous substance
and either a) suffer no ill effects at all, or b) receive a useful fact from
the referee about the substance\u2019s effects, nature, or origin.

  - Gas mask (ignore breathing-based damage), +1 FORCEFUL
`,`**HEADSPACE:** You walk softly among the myriad glimmering beauties and
horrors of the subconscious mind made manifest. Once per mission, you
(and anyone physically touching you) may leap into the subconscious of
a thinking being and explore it as a physical space, complete with objects,
flora, fauna, and in some cases enemies. Even the slightest alteration
to this physicalized headspace can have rippling consequences on the
gestalt consciousness above, so it is imperative that any psychonaut
be deliberate and controlled during their expedition into thought.

  - Psycho-recorder (makes a mind backup tape, one use), -2 FORCEFUL
`,`**HEAVYWEIGHT:** You can tear through most inanimate obstacles with
ease. If it\u2019s something really tough, like solid concrete or metal, it will be
more difficult and complicated\u2014the referee will explain how.

  - Break-action shotgun (1D6+1 DAMAGE), +1 FORCEFUL
`,`**HENSHIN:** Using your device, you can take on another form. This alternate
form has 1D6 HP (reroll each time) and starts with one additional trait. If
you reach 0 HP while transformed, you\u2019re knocked out for a few minutes,
revert to normal, and can\u2019t transform again until the next mission.

  - Mystery device (wearable), -1 to ARMOR in normal form
`,`**HEX:** You can place any being under a hex, depriving them of good luck.
For as long as you hold someone in your web of tainted fate, something
of your choice always goes wrong\u2014guns always jam, vehicles always
fail to start, etc. Until you break the hex, it applies to you as well.

  - Ritual dagger (1D6 DAMAGE, double vs. divine beings), +1 CREATIVE
`,`**HIGHLANDER:** When you kill someone important, you may gain a trait,
but not the associated stat bonus or item, based on any special abilities
they may have. The referee decides who is important.

  - Ancient longsword (1D6+1 DAMAGE), +1 FORCEFUL
`,`**HIJACK:** You can take control of any occupied vehicle and toss aside its
operator without rolling the dice, as long as the operator is exposed. For
closed and/or armored vehicles, the process of hijacking will be more
difficult and complicated\u2014the referee will tell you how.

  - Hotwiring kit (hotwire any inert vehicle, one use), +1 FORCEFUL
`,`**HOLY:** You may be a god, an angel, a pious believer, or a power-drunk
zealot\u2014whatever your relationship is to the divine, choose a conceptual
domain to which you belong (such as balance, love, or war). Once
per mission, you may trace a holy circle upon the ground (ten feet
in diameter), over which all things antithetical to your domain cannot
cross. The referee has the final say on which things are truly antithetical,
unless you spend one WAR DIE to preach over them.

  - Bow of solid light (1D6+CRE DAMAGE), +1 DAMAGE vs. antithetical
`,`**HUNTER:** You can track anything that leaves a trail, as though the ability
were instinctual. When you find it, you can roll +TACTICAL to observe it
without detection.

  - Compound bow (1D6 damage, silent), +1 TACTICAL
`,`**HYBRID:** You are genetically spliced with an animal of your choice. You
gain +1 to an attribute that you and the referee agree makes sense for
your animal (+1 FORCEFUL for a shark, +1 REFLEXIVE for a hummingbird,
etc.). Animals of the same type will always see you as one of their own,
and tend towards trusting anyone you're with. Unfortunately, all worn
armor is 1 point less effective due to its incorrect fit.

  - Animal feed (+1D6 HP, one use), +1 to chosen attribute
`,`**HYPNOSIS:** Your sustained state of self-hypnosis maximizes efficiency,
but requires a suspended sense of self. Any time you do something risky
while hypnotized, you can reroll one die (keeping lower results). If you
muster any sentiment, your hypnosis ends for the rest of the mission.

  - Nutrient slurry (+2D6 HP, one use), -2 CREATIVE
`,`**ICEBREAKER:** You know how to get the party started. When you land
the first strike in a fight, gain a WAR DIE and deal double DAMAGE. Take
double DAMAGE whenever you are struck by an unexpected attack.

  - Tactical battleaxe (1D6+1 DAMAGE), +2 FORCEFUL
`,`**ILLUSION:** If you're free to gesture, you can attempt to manipulate another
person into hallucinating anything of your choice by rolling +CREATIVE.
Rolling higher creates a more believable illusion, and illusions born of lower
rolls may be influenced by the contents of the victim's psyche.

  - Whip (1D6 DAMAGE), +1 CREATIVE
`,`**IMPROVISE:** You can improvise a weapon from two or more common
objects to instantly kill a single enemy once per mission. You can
always create this makeshift weapon discreetly and quickly, even while
restrained or otherwise incapacitated, without rolling the dice.

  - Slingshot (3 DAMAGE), +1 CREATIVE
`,`**INJECTION:** You are addicted to an experimental serum that increases
your combat ability. During combat, you can inject and deal double
damage until the fight is won. Each time you inject, decrease your MAX
HP by 3. At the end of a mission, your MAX HP returns to its normal
amount.

  - Automatic injection suit (2 ARMOR), -1 REFLEXIVE
`,`**INSURANCE:** When you take this trait, write your \u201Cwill.\u201D Your will may
be modified, but only once per mission. If you die permanently, your
traits (not including this one), skill modifiers (positive and negative),
and items are distributed to other characters according to your will.

  - Briefcase full of cash (a small fortune), +1 to chosen attribute
`,`**INTERROGATION:** You can lock an unsuspecting enemy in a chokehold
and ask them one question, which they will always answer truthfully
before trying to escape.

  - Combat knife (1D6 DAMAGE), +1 FORCEFUL
`,`**JANITOR:** You can clean up any mess in minutes and always have the
supplies on hand to do so. If someone interrupts your cleaning or makes
the mess worse, you have +2 on DAMAGE rolls against them.

  - Mop (3 DAMAGE), +1 FORCEFUL
`,`**JINX:** Bad luck has followed you for your entire life. Once per mission,
you can say \u201CI feel like something really bad is about to happen\u201D or an
equivalent phrase, and it does. It will be bad for you and all nearby
characters. The resulting catastrophe completely interrupts the scene
and can cancel incoming damage, disorient enemies, etc.

  - Mirror (break to reroll any roll and take the lower result), +1D6 MAX HP
`,`**JOKER:** You never take anything too seriously. If you choose to do
something risky not because it is right or good, but because it would
be funny (and everyone playing agrees), roll 3D6 and take the best two.

  - Joke pistol (shoots \u201CBANG!\u201D flag), -2 TACTICAL
`,`**KNIGHT:** You follow a strict code of honor and unquestioningly serve a
powerful person or organization of your choice (note that FIST is not a
powerful organization). You deal +1 DAMAGE if you have not yet broken
your code of honor during a mission. Your role is irrelevant: you can only
advance by increasing the wealth, power, or status of those you serve.
Should your superiors die, your role becomes WANDERER.

  - Medieval helmet (1 ARMOR, accessory), -1 CREATIVE
`,`**LIMBS:** You have many appendages (additional arms, spider-like legs,
tentacles, etc.) When you are attempting to catch something or grapple
someone, roll twice and take the best result.

  - Many knives (1D6+1 DAMAGE), +1 REFLEXIVE
`,`**LIMIT:** When pushed to the brink of your capacity for punishment, you
unlock new wells of power. If you have already fulfilled your role during
the course of a mission and your HP is equal to 1, you may immediately
advance now, instead of when the mission ends.

  - Mercury-core executioner\u2019s sword (1D6+FRC DAMAGE), +2 MAX HP
`,`**LINK:** Touching someone\u2019s skin bonds their soul to yours. When you take
damage, they take the same amount and vice versa. You may speak
telepathically and share each other\u2019s senses (one at a time).

  - Thick gloves (must be removed to establish link), +1 REFLEXIVE
`,`**LISTEN:** You have incredibly sensitive and specific hearing, but a
tumultuous relationship with the rest of your senses. You may always
perfectly eavesdrop on conversations, listen for tell-tale sounds, and
approximate the locations of things you can\u2019t see without rolling the
dice, but loud noises, bright lights, strong smells, grating textures, and
intense tastes all deal 1 DAMAGE when you are first exposed to them.

  - Blindfold (helps you focus), +2 REFLEXIVE
`,`**LOVER:** If you and another player both have this trait, you can choose,
together, to become lovers. If you rescued your lover from the brink of
death during the mission, you both gain 1 WAR DIE at the end. There is
no limit to how many lovers you can have, but if a lover of yours dies,
your character can no longer gain new traits when advancing.

  - Silver handgun (1D6 damage, double vs. undead), +1 ARMOR when
protecting others
`,`**LUSH:** You prefer to fight at least half in the bag. When you have some
free time, you can tip back your liquor bottle and take +2 to your next
FORCEFUL roll.

  - Liquor bottle (one use), +1 WAR DIE per mission
`,`**LYCANTHROPE:** At night, you transform and gain the HYBRID trait (but
not the associated item). If you have transformed during a mission, your
role becomes irrelevant, and you can only advance by fulfilling a specific
animal desire\u2014roll 1D6 to let it wash over you (1-2: Challenge yourself as
hunter or prey, 3-4: Consume the lifeforce of several human beings, 5-6:
Stage a grand sacrifice to the gods of the Moon).

  - Handcuffs (titanium-reinforced), +6 MAX HP in animal form
`,`**MASCOT:** You are the beautifully fragile glue which bolsters the team\u2019s
spirit and binds them together. Your MAX HP is irrelevant\u2014for the
purposes of play, it is always equal to 1. As long as you are alive, your
remaining MAX HP is divided as evenly as possible and added onto the
MAX HP of every other player (e.g. a 6 MAX HP MASCOT in a four-player
team grants 1, 2, and 2 MAX HP to the other three players).

  - Extravagant costume (draws enemy fire), -2 FORCEFUL
`,`**MECHANIC:** With a reasonable amount of prep time, you can use your
toolbox to repair any machine for 1D6+TACTICAL HP.

  - Toolbox (repair 1D6+TAC HP, three uses), +1 TACTICAL
`,`**MEDIC:** With a reasonable amount of prep time, you can use your medkit to
heal any ailment. For other healing items, add your TAC to the HP regained.

  - Medkit (heal 1D6+TAC HP, three uses), +1 TACTICAL
`,`**MERCY:** When you would deal a killing blow to a non-player character,
you may choose to instead approach them, help them up, and show
them mercy. Characters who have been shown your mercy can never
take DAMAGE again, and will always treat you (but not necessarily
anyone else) as a trustworthy and reliable friend.

  - Halo (make someone change their ways, one use), -1 FORCEFUL
`,`**MIMIC:** You can shapeshift, but only into inanimate objects. Once per
mission, you may transform into a single item no larger than a car. If you
transform into a tool, machine, etc., you are fully functional and may be
used as such by others.

  - Varnish (+1D6 HP while mimic, one use), +2 MAX HP
`,`**MINDREADER:** You can read anyone\u2019s thoughts and general state of mind
without rolling. You may roll +CREATIVE to scan for specific information,
such as names, passwords, memories, and images. Unfortunately, you
are particularly susceptible to interference, and the thoughts of others
often cloud your psyche. Your mindreading ability is neutralized in the
presence of another mindreader, and vice versa.

  - X-ray specs (see through walls), -1 CREATIVE
`,`**MOBILITY:** Your customized mobility aid (e.g. a titanium cane with
spring-loaded feet, or a wheelchair with adaptive tank treads) is tricked
out with additional gadgets and features. Choose one of the following
add-ons, active when you're using the aid: 1) +1 to an attribute of your
choice, 2) an always-concealable weapon that deals 1D6 DAMAGE, or 3)
+1 to your ARMOR. If you roll the dice to do something risky that would
normally involve your mobility aid, but you don't have access to it, roll
3D6 and take the worst two. When you advance, you can get another
add-on instead of taking one of the usual advancement rewards.

  - Mobility aid (comes with an add-on), +1 REFLEXIVE
`,`**MOMENTUM:** You are able to enter a state of cumulative momentum at
will, harnessing inertia to your advantage. Each time you succeed on
a REFLEXIVE roll, gain +1 REFLEXIVE. This bonus accumulates until you
stop moving, at which point your REFLEXIVE attribute reverts back to
normal. Rolling a failure with a cumulative bonus from this trait will incur
DAMAGE equal to the bonus, and cause you to stop moving.

  - Rail-grinding boots (grind on any edge), +1 REFLEXIVE
`,`**MONOLOGUE:** When you give an impassioned ethical, political, or
philosophical speech, roll +CREATIVE. On a partial success, you engage
your target in the melodramatic speech, temporarily distracting them.
On a full success, they see your line of reasoning and make an effort to
join your school of thought.

  - Yorick\u2019s skull prop (very realistic), +2 CREATIVE
`,`**MONSTERS:** Once per mission, you may use your computerized monster
index to summon and command a monster from the barcode of any
real-life object you have with you. Arrange the numbers in the barcode
from lowest to highest and derive your monster's stats as follows:
DAMAGE equal to 1D6 + the lowest number, HP equal to the highest
number, and ARMOR equal to the middle number (if there are two,
split the difference and round down). State and record the monster's
appearance and name, and work out a special power with the referee
that reflects the origin object (e.g. belches of flame from a bottle of hot
sauce or answering any one question from a library card).

  - Monster index (hold aloft to summon a monster), -1 REFLEXIVE
`,`**MORBID:** You have some kind of relationship with death. Describe how,
and what form death takes. If you or another character dies, you can
call death to your side. Death will give you some task or challenge and
a time limit, then the dead character is healed by 1D6. If you don\u2019t
complete the task within the time limit, death takes you both.

  - Gifted scythe (2D6 DAMAGE), -2 MAX HP
`,`**MURDER:** You\u2019re followed by a heckling murder of crows that spout
various ominous phrases (some helpful). The crows circle when someone
is soon to die, foreshadowing danger. You may command the crows to
circle around an enemy, who takes +1 DAMAGE from all sources until the
crows get bored and leave.

  - Birdseed (guarantee a helpful omen, one use), +1 TACTICAL
`,`**MUTANT:** You are a picture of evolution in microcosm, always changing
form as your unstable genome shifts. At the beginning of each mission,
roll 1D6. On a 4+, drop any one trait you already have (except MUTANT),
and permanently replace it with another, recalculating your attributes.

  - Toxic grenade (1D6+2 damage, one use), -1 TACTICAL
`,`**NEUROMANCER:** Given a few hours in a quiet place, you can remove
brains from their bodies and put them in new ones. Body transplantation
is not a perfect science, and those who have undergone the process
may not always come back the same.

  - Brain jar (keeps one brain alive), +1 CREATIVE
`,`**NINJA:** Due to your training in the dark arts of subterfuge, any acrobatic
or athletic action you take will always be completely silent, even when
you roll failures. You may choose your current ninja weapon at the
beginning of each mission: shuriken (1D6 DAMAGE), kunai (3 DAMAGE,
usable for climbing), or smoke bomb (temporarily disorient 1D6 targets).

  - Ninja weapon (six uses), +1 REFLEXIVE
`,`**NOIR:** You\u2019re from the old days, when crime ran the streets, the cigarettes
were plentiful, and hard work meant something. You gain +1 on rolls you
provide an appropriate monologue for.

  - Trench coat (1 ARMOR), +1 FORCEFUL
`,`**NUMBERS:** All numbers have meaning. At the beginning of each mission,
roll 1D6. Once per mission, you may replace any number with the number
rolled. This can be another roll (such as damage) or a number-based
fact spoken by the referee (five enemies, ten days, six stars, etc.)

  - Sudoku workbook (keep someone occupied, one use), +1 TACTICAL
`,`**OBJECTS:** You may attack with any non-weapon object within reach\u2014if
you describe a unique, creative way of causing harm with this object, it
functions as a weapon which deals 1D6 DAMAGE. Subsequent objects
you attack with add a cumulative +1 DAMAGE bonus per new object;
this cumulative bonus resets to 0 when you roll a failure, reuse an attack
description, or switch to a conventional weapon.

  - Leather belt (3 DAMAGE), +1 CREATIVE
`,`**OOZE:** You can transform into a gelatinous substance at will. While in
your gelatinous form, you have -2 REFLEXIVE and -2 FORCEFUL, but you
can squeeze through grates, fit inside containers, and split into pieces.

  - Bucket (5 gallon), +1 REFLEXIVE
`,`**PAINLESS:** You cannot feel pain, and being hurt will never cause you to
flinch or stop what you\u2019re doing. At the beginning of each mission, the
referee will roll 1D6 and keep the result hidden from you. The first time
you reach 0 HP during the mission, you will regain HP equal to the result.

  - Wrist and ankle weights (1 ARMOR, accessory), -2 REFLEXIVE
`,`**PARKOUR:** You can easily swing, jump, and free-run across rooftops and
rafters without rolling the dice. If it\u2019s something really precarious, like
barrels floating in toxic waste or a rope bridge full of people shooting
at you, you can still do it, but you\u2019ll drop one of your items in an
inconvenient spot\u2014the referee decides what, and where.

  - Baseball bat (1D6 DAMAGE), +1 REFLEXIVE
`,`**PATHETIC:** You are entirely unintimidating and almost universally pitied.
Enemies often underestimate you. Once per mission, before you take
damage, you may look into an enemy\u2019s eyes and nullify it.

  - Box of tissues (hides a pistol inside, 1D6 DAMAGE), -1 FORCEFUL
`,`**PET:** You have a small pet (1-3 HP, referee's choice) which you always
keep on your person\u2014perhaps in a shirt pocket, on your shoulder, or
leashed to your belt. Describe your pet and choose a bonus for them:
1) grants 1 ARMOR and functions as an accessory, 2) grants +1 to an
attribute of your choice for a single roll when fed a treat, 3) deals 3
DAMAGE to an enemy when fed a treat. If your pet dies, you can start
the next mission with a new one, but not with the same bonus as before.

  - Pet treats (three uses), -1 REFLEXIVE
`,`**PHONE:** You may make telepathic \u201Ccalls\u201D to anyone regardless of time,
distance, or interdimensional status\u2014these calls may be routed through
local telephones and radios, or may simply appear as a disembodied
voice. Those you call are not guaranteed to answer. Sometimes, you\u2019ll
receive calls you\u2019d prefer not to.

  - Rolodex (3 strange and important people are listed), +1 CREATIVE
`,`**PIRATE:** You're a free spirit who prefers a life of spontaneous adventure
on the high seas. Whenever you roll the dice to do something risky
involving the ocean, stealing, or taking over a crewed vessel, roll 3D6
and take the best two.

  - Illegally modified LMG (1D6+2 DAMAGE), -1 TACTICAL
`,`**POCKET:** You can fit pretty much anything into your personal pocket
dimension (and retrieve it at will) as long as you are not restrained or
particularly distracted. Your pocket-space might be accessed through a
bottomless bag, a door that follows you between rooms, or a wormhole
you can summon with a wish.

  - Refrigerator (well-stocked), -1 REFLEXIVE
`,`**POLYGLOT:** You can understand and communicate in any mundane
language, written or verbal. You can also roll +TACTICAL to understand
languages which are supernatural in origin.

  - Universal phrasebook (can teach anyone one phrase), +1 CREATIVE
`,`**PRECOGNITION:** Once per mission, before you roll the dice to do something
risky, you may declare a state of precognition\u2014have everyone mark
down where they are, their HP and items, and any other useful notes to
capture the current situation. Roll the dice and continue play as normal.
Next time you're prompted to roll the dice, decide if what's happened
was your destined path, or in fact a mere possible future\u2014if so, rewind
the story using everyone's notes, keeping in mind that small distortions
in reality are a normal consequence of precognitive radiation.

  - Stopwatch (waterproof), -2 TACTICAL
`,`**PREPPER:** You are perpetually awaiting the moment when the world goes
to shit. When each mission starts, choose a specific survival skill you\u2019ve
been practicing (e.g. knot-tying, finding water, or securing shelter).
Add +2 whenever you roll the dice to do something risky involving your
current survival skill, and gain an additional +1 HP whenever you heal
from eating MREs or other non-perishables.

  - Hatchet (3 DAMAGE), +1 TACTICAL
`,`**PROJECTION:** You can project your spirit from your body to access any
faraway place remotely, as long as your physical body is safe. You can
also cheat death and keep 1 HP once per mission by abandoning your
body, but you will be stuck in spirit form until it gets medical attention.

  - Flowing garment (1 ARMOR), +1 CREATIVE
`,`**PROSTHETIC:** One of your limbs is replaced with any weapon you own,
and you can equip another weapon to use. When you roll the maximum
damage possible with an equipped weapon, you can roll damage again
with your limb-weapon for an extra powerful combo attack.

  - Light machine gun (1D6+1 DAMAGE), -1 REFLEXIVE
`,`**PSYCHOMETRY:** Once per mission, you can ask any inanimate object
you are touching a psychic question. Objects will answer truthfully, but
are limited by their experience\u2014a photograph cannot comprehend the
passage of time, and a gun can only think in terms of killing.

  - Scrapbook (contains one mission-relevant photo), +1 CREATIVE
`,`**PUNCTUAL:** You always know what time it is, down to the second. When
you need to get to a time-sensitive event, appointment, or meeting, you
will always get there in the nick of time. If arriving on time is particularly
unlikely, the referee will tell you in what way you are unprepared for it
when you get there.

  - Gold stopwatch (always works), +1 REFLEXIVE
`,`**PUPPETMASTER:** You can implant a command in someone\u2019s brain by
rolling the dice +FORCEFUL. If you succeed, they are forced to comply.

  - Strappy leather harness (1 ARMOR), +1 FORCEFUL
`,`**PYROMANIAC:** If there is something flammable nearby, you can always
ignite it, but the fire will uncontrollably spread somewhere inconvenient\u2014
the referee will tell you where.

  - Flamethrower (1D6+2 DAMAGE), +2 FORCEFUL
`,`**QUANTUM:** If another player\u2019s character dies, you may rewind time to
shortly before their death and permanently swap characters with them,
giving you a second chance to save their life. Swapping back into a
body you\u2019ve inhabited before kills the one you\u2019re leaving.

  - Quantum stabilizer suit (2 ARMOR), +1 CREATIVE
`,`**QUILLS:** You are covered in quills, spines, or thorns. When an enemy
deals damage to you in melee combat, they take 1 DAMAGE in return. In
addition, you may shoot the spines out of your body for 1D6 DAMAGE
to everyone in the area, though you\u2019ll need a day to grow them back.

  - Ripped jacket (1 ARMOR), +2 MAX HP
`,`**RADIOACTIVE:** When you aren\u2019t wearing your treated bandages, radiation
bursts forth from your body and deals 2D6 DAMAGE to anyone near
you. When this occurs, you may attempt to direct the attack at a single
target by rolling +FORCEFUL. After the damage is dealt, the radiation
temporarily dissipates, but you will quickly waste away and die if your
treated bandages are not reapplied.

  - Treated bandages (accessory), -2 FORCEFUL
`,`**RAGE:** Whenever you do something risky that\u2019s loud, bloody, and violent,
roll 3D6 and take the best two. Any other time you do something risky,
roll 3D6 and take the worst two. Enemies who you hurt have a 1 in 6
chance of immediately attempting to flee the scene.

  - Ultra-shotgun (2D6 DAMAGE), -1 CREATIVE
`,`**RECRUIT:** If you bring an unconscious enemy back to base with you at
the end of a mission, you may take them with you on future missions as
another character you control. Recruits retain their currently equipped
weapon and armor and may have up to one trait, decided by the referee.
Recruits start with 1D6 MAX HP and gain 3 MAX HP for each mission
they complete alongside you.

  - Tranq pistol (0 DAMAGE, 3-in-1D6 chance to knockout), +1 CREATIVE
`,`**RELOAD:** When you\u2019re about to attack with a ranged weapon, you can
choose to dig in your heels, slam in another mag, and unload a whole
clip. You will deal double DAMAGE, but any damage you take until finding
cover will also be doubled.

  - Grenade (1D6 DAMAGE, one use), +1 REFLEXIVE
`,`**RETREAT:** You have a place in your head (a cozy cabin, a crystal palace,
a concrete cell, etc.) that you can manifest physically. Once per mission,
you may roll +CREATIVE to transport yourself and up to four other people
there. The specifics of the retreat may be changed at will, resting there
heals 1D6 HP, and you or your guests may leave at any time.

  - Polaroid camera (for memories), +1 CREATIVE
`,`**RIVAL:** Choose any other player to be your rival. Each time you
spectacularly one-up or humiliate your rival, heal 1D6 HP. If your rival
thoroughly one-ups you, you lose any WAR DICE you have. When you
take this trait, you gain a new aesthetic feature, like a streak of dyed
hair, an eyepatch, or a cool scar.

  - Carbine (1D6 DAMAGE), +1 DAMAGE when showing off
`,`**ROBOT:** You are a man-made automaton bound by your rigid programming.
When you take this trait, select another player to be your programmer
(or allow all of the players to program you democratically). When a
mission begins, your programmer(s) should define a three-word core
directive for you to follow, such as \u201CELIMINATE ALL HOSTILES," \u201CSEARCH
NEW AREAS," or \u201CPROTECT THE TEAM." Your programmer(s) should also
select a broad concept which \u201Cdoes not compute," such as love, music,
or peace. When you roll the dice to do something risky while acting
on your core directive, roll 3D6 and take the best two. When you are
exposed to something which does not compute, drop what you're
doing and shut down for ten minutes, or take 1D6 DAMAGE.

  - Laser rifle (1D6+1 DAMAGE), -1 CREATIVE
`,`**RUNNER:** You possess ultrahuman speed. Once per mission, you may
outpace someone or something. If it\u2019s something really fast, like a
hunting cheetah or a flying bullet, there will be a complication from
over-exertion\u2014the referee will tell you what.

  - Experimental sneakers (indestructible), +1 REFLEXIVE
`,`**SAWBONES:** You\u2019re a doctor, but you don\u2019t have a medical license. Once
per mission, when a player character dies, you can roll +CREATIVE to
perform surgery and resurrect them with full health. You must swap out
one of their traits for a new one as part of your experimental surgery,
and explain why your operation changed their trait.

  - Bone saw (1D6+1 DAMAGE), -2 MAX HP
`,`**SCAVENGER:** You understand that everything can be repurposed and
that nothing need go to waste. If the referee narrates that you've run
out of a finite resource (like ammo, medicine, or food), you may spend
a WAR DIE and roll it to negate the referee and reveal your backup
reserves, equal to the result rolled (e.g. 2 clips of ammo, 4 doses of
antivenom, or 6 MREs). You always gain a WAR DIE at rendezvous points.

  - Semi-automatic rifle (1D6+1 DAMAGE), +1 TACTICAL
`,`**SCOUT:** You always get the lay of the land before starting a mission. You
can find a good vantage point or hiding place anywhere, any time. The
referee will always tell you about ambushes and hidden traps.

  - Ghillie suit (disguise self as plant), +1 TACTICAL
`,`**SEAL:** You are a living lock for the cage of something horrible (you don\u2019t
know what). You have complex tattoos and carvings across your entire
body. If you die before the appointed time (also unknown), you release
whatever you\u2019re holding back into the world.

  - Wards and charms (accessory), +1 REFLEXIVE
`,`**SECURITY:** If you have a reasonable amount of prep time and the coast
is clear, you can use your anti-security kit and attempt to breach any
lock or crack any safe by rolling +REFLEXIVE. You may also disarm traps
you know about and can physically reach by rolling +TACTICAL.

  - Anti-security kit (three uses), +1 REFLEXIVE
`,`**SEDUCE:** When someone wants to get with you, you can fade to black
and get with them too. After you return from a nearby private retreat,
roll +CREATIVE and choose one result on a partial success, or two on a
full success: they want to help you, they trust you with their secrets,
or they want to get with you again. On a failure, you're old news, and
they'll dislike your company from now on.

  - Little black dress (0 ARMOR, stand out anywhere), +1 CREATIVE
`,`**SEER:** When you have a moment of peace and quiet, you may read your
divination tool (perhaps a deck of playing cards or a set of polyhedral
dice) and roll +CREATIVE. If you succeed, the referee will answer one
question about the current mission honestly. If it\u2019s a partial success,
they\u2019ll answer vaguely. A failure brings a grim and terrible omen.

  - Divination tool, +1 CREATIVE
`,`**SEXY:** You\u2019re so hot, and everyone knows it, you most of all. When
you\u2019re wearing your fetching outfit, you can stun another person with
your beauty without rolling the dice. If you take damage in the outfit,
you have to stay out of the fight until it\u2019s over to attend to chipped
nails, untucked shirts, and messed up hairdos.

  - Fetching outfit (0 ARMOR), -1 REFLEXIVE
`,`**SHARPSHOOTER:** If you name a specific body part, possession, or
component of something you\u2019re attacking with a ranged weapon, you
will always hit it, temporarily disabling that part but dealing 0 DAMAGE.

  - Revolver (1D6+1 DAMAGE), +1 REFLEXIVE
`,`**SHIELD:** You can use any shield as a weapon which bashes enemies for
1D6 DAMAGE plus the shield\u2019s ARMOR bonus. If you throw the shield as
a ranged weapon, you can roll +REFLEXIVE to ricochet it back to you.

  - Combat shield (0 ARMOR, accessory), +1 FORCEFUL
`,`**SHOW:** Your performance art (perhaps music, dance, acrobatics, or
comedy) has inexplicable mind-altering effects on its audience. While
performing, choose one of the following: your allies have +1 to an
attribute of your choice, enemies are dazed (they deal -1 DAMAGE), or
one enemy gives in to fun. You take -1 to any rolls made while performing.

  - Performing accoutrement (e.g. instrument, baton, mic), +1 CREATIVE
`,`**SHRINK:** Your unique atomic structure allows you to compress yourself
down to a millimeter tall without rolling the dice. If you go smaller, you
must roll +TACTICAL to avoid slipping through a hole in the quantum foam.
Those who slip through the foam suffer mind-bending consequences,
like becoming marooned or losing their sense of time (referee's call).

  - Stainless steel syringe (contains a miniature submarine), +2 MAX HP
`,`**SKELETON:** You have no flesh\u2014explain why. You have 2 ARMOR against
weapons that pierce or slash, and take +1 DAMAGE from weapons that
bludgeon. If you reach 0 HP but all your bones are intact, you may rise
with 1 HP after someone else completely reassembles you.

  - Ownerless femur (1D6 DAMAGE), -2 FORCEFUL
`,`**SLACKER:** You abide by the universe in all things and appreciate simple
pleasures. In addition to the single rendezvous point all player characters
can use, you may always access an additional, second rendezvous
point which is typically easy to reach and additionally contains snacks,
substances, a hammock, or similar amenities.

  - Shabby clothes (0 ARMOR, always unthreatening), -1 TACTICAL
`,`**SLEEPER:** Your personality is but a programmed front to hide the
dormant sleeper agent beneath (or maybe it\u2019s the other way around).
When you take this trait, everyone at the table but you should come
to a consensus on what your activation phrase is (like \u201Cthe woman
in white walks backwards through Prague,\u201D or \u201CEpsilon orange Manila
seventeen\u201D). Once it\u2019s decided, write it down, and create a new, second
FIST character who shares none of your traits\u2014this is your sleeper
persona (if you have already advanced, advance the persona an equal
number of times, but do not choose the same advancement options).
Any time you hear your activation phrase, you swap between personas,
but the items in your inventory do not change to match your traits until
you start a new mission.

  - Tape recorder (plays activation phrase), -1 CREATIVE
`,`**SLOW-MO:** You may slow time to a crawl (at a 1-to-1 seconds-to-minutes
ratio) at will, turning volleys of gunfire into glittering armadas of hot
lead ships. Doing so costs you 1 HP for every second of time you slow.
Slow-time affects your actions and physical processes but does not
change the speed of your thoughts, giving you lightning-fast cognition
relative to those around you. During slowed time, your REFLEXIVE score
is increased by 4.

  - Machine pistol (1D6 DAMAGE), -2 REFLEXIVE
`,`**SMASH:** You break things. You deal +1 DAMAGE against any man-made
construct, and another +1 DAMAGE against anything that is grossly
expensive or has exquisitely fragile components.

  - Sledgehammer (1D6+1 DAMAGE), +1 FORCEFUL
`,`**SMITH:** You may deploy your portable workbench once per mission to
add a new effect to an existing weapon (you can choose a premade
weapon tag or negotiate a custom effect with the referee). The effect
will be successfully added if you leave the weapon at the workbench,
acquire three integral but difficult-to-reach components, and return to
combine the components and weapon. The referee will tell you what
and where the components are; they are usually scattered throughout
the mission area. You may also employ a similar process of deploying
your workbench and collecting materials to forge new pieces of armor.

  - Portable workbench (one use), +1 TACTICAL
`,`**SMOKER:** You are addicted to nicotine. When you have some downtime,
you can calm your nerves with a cigarette and take +2 to your next
REFLEXIVE roll.

  - Cigarette case (one use), +1 WAR DIE per mission
`,`**SNATCHER:** You are an alien poorly puppeteering a technically dead
human body, with a killing touch. If you do not consume one human
brain without anyone finding out once per mission, you will melt into a
puddle and die.

  - Poison fingertips (2D6 damage, don't count as equipped), -2 CREATIVE
`,`**SNEAK:** If you hold still in a good hiding spot, no one will detect you
until you make your presence known. You can also easily fit into small
containers like barrels and cardboard boxes.

  - Sneaking suit (1 ARMOR), +1 REFLEXIVE
`,`**SNIPER:** If you have prep time, the enemy is unaware of your presence,
and you remain stationary, you can roll 3D6 to attack and use the best
two dice. If you succeed, you deal the maximum possible DAMAGE for
your weapon.

  - Sniper rifle (1D6+2 DAMAGE), +1 DAMAGE with ranged weapons
`,`**SOAK:** You know how to grin and bear it. When you take damage, you
may roll a WAR DIE and subtract that much from the DAMAGE taken. You
may also apply this effect to anyone standing immediately behind you.

  - Kinetic shock shield (2 ARMOR, equip as weapon), -2 REFLEXIVE
`,`**SOCIAL:** You have a likable personality and a familiar face. Take +1 to your
roll whenever you do something risky that involves a social interaction.

  - Cyanide pill (one use), +1 CREATIVE
`,`**SPY:** You are a dashing and clever international person of mystery. Major
antagonists tend to behave in contrived and theatrical ways around
you. If you are captured, you may ask the referee to give you an easy
opportunity to escape and they will give it to you.

  - Laser watch (3 DAMAGE, can cut any restraints), +1 TACTICAL
`,`**STAND:** You command a flamboyant spirit with its own trait, tangible
only to you but able to affect the corporeal world. Roll a random trait
for your stand (D666) and choose a hyper-specific additional bonus,
like \u201Ccan be used twice per mission if my blood is removed and replaced\u201D
or \u201Cdeals double DAMAGE if the target is left-handed.\u201D Everyone else at
the table should democratically decide on a hyper-specific condition or
downside, such as \u201Ccan only be used when Mercury is in retrograde\u201D or
\u201Ccauses a random bone in the user\u2019s body to break when used.\u201D

  - Stand (immortal and invisible), +1 FORCEFUL
`,`**STATIC:** You can enter and travel between electronic screens of any kind
as long as the screen isn\u2019t too \u201Cbusy\u201D (plain backgrounds and static
work best).

  - Chaff grenade (disables electronics, one use), +1 REFLEXIVE
`,`**STATUESQUE:** You\u2019re made of something hard (stone, metal, gems, etc.)
Once per mission, you can reflect any projectile back at the attacker. If
you are also wearing armor, decrease your REFLEXIVE score by 2.

  - Tough exterior (2 ARMOR, doesn't count as equipped), +1 FORCEFUL
`,`**STICKY:** You can secrete a sticky substance from your body which
dries in seconds and is comparable in strength to the most powerful
mundane adhesives. It can only be dissolved with a common substance
of your choice (water, alcohol, blood, etc.)

  - Flask of dissolving fluid (8 ounces), -1 REFLEXIVE
`,`**STONER:** You function much better while high. When you have the time,
you can enjoy your favorite strain using any method of your choice.
State the name of the strain (e.g. \u201CGreen Giant" or \u201CNuclear Winter"),
and choose a bonus: +1D6 HP, or +2 to your next roll.

  - Personal stash (one use), +1 WAR DIE per mission
`,`**STRETCH:** You can stretch any of your limbs to a length of ten feet \xD7
your MAX HP by rolling the dice +REFLEXIVE. Stretched out limbs can be
pushed even further, but will incur 1 DAMAGE for every additional ten
feet of stretch. You take +1 DAMAGE when enemies specifically target
stretched-out limbs.

  - Elastic bodysuit (0 ARMOR, up to 1000 sq. ft. of fabric), -1 FORCEFUL
`,`**STUBBORN:** You're one tough son of a bitch, and not even God can keep
you down for long. When you roll a failure and the referee narrates what
happens next, you can spend a WAR DIE and declare that it doesn't,
forcing the referee to narrate an entirely different failure outcome
instead.

  - Special cigar (+1D6 HP, one use), -2 CREATIVE
`,`**SUMMONER:** You know the deepest, truest names of two phantasmagoric
entities (demons, elementals, Platonic ideals, etc.) and their domains of
power (such as grief, fire, or logic). You can summon them via fire-circle
with ten minutes of unbroken ritual, or instantly by spending a WAR DIE.
Each of these spirits will carry out a single magical command related
to their domain of power before vanishing, and tend towards bad-faith
or misguided interpretations of vaguely worded instructions. Magical
attacks from summoned spirits deal 2D6 DAMAGE, and double DAMAGE
if their domain is well-suited to the attack (like fire against ice, or silver
against werewolves). When you advance, you may add another spirit to
your roster instead of taking one of the usual advancement rewards.

  - Box of tea lights (one circle's worth, one use), +1 CREATIVE
`,`**SUNDER:** Using your psionic powers, you may sunder the mind of anyone
you presently perceive, dealing 1D6 DAMAGE which ignores ARMOR. You
may roll additional six-sided dice and add them to the total DAMAGE
at will. Opening a psionic channel strains your body (perhaps causing
nosebleeds, shaking, or confusion), and you will always take DAMAGE
equal to half of what you deal, rounded down.

  - Grippy socks (prevent you from slipping), -2 FORCEFUL
`,`**SUPPLY:** You know secret frequencies and can use your radio to get
any item delivered in a pinch; however, there will be a catch, like an
inconvenient pickup spot or a fault with the item\u2014the referee decides.

  - Supply radio (three uses), +1 TACTICAL
`,`**SURVEILLANCE:** You can install your camera drone somewhere stationary
and surveil without detection. You can also keep it mobile and control
it at will, but it will be exposed to enemy attacks.

  - Camera drone (1 HP, one use), +1 TACTICAL
`,`**SYMBIOTE:** You\u2019re bonded to a violent symbiotic lifeform with whom
you share a tumultuous and intimate relationship. The constant
commentary by a chorus of alien voices makes it difficult to hold on to
your thoughts or focus on tasks. Your role is irrelevant\u2014you can only
advance by following the whims of the creature (roll D6, 1-2: Trust no
one, not even for a moment, 3-4: Destroy something important, 5-6:
Backstab a teammate before they backstab you).

  - In-vivo symbiote (+2 ARMOR vs. attacks from behind), -1 TACTICAL
`,`**SYNTHETIC:** You are a human-like android. Your positronic brain can
make thousands of calculations per second, and you never have to roll
the dice for tasks like solving equations and calculating trajectories.
You take 1D6 DAMAGE when your innards are exposed to water.

  - Infantry-scale railgun (1D6+2 DAMAGE), +1 TACTICAL
`,`**TACTICIAN:** If you explain an elaborate plan of action to the team, all
partial success rolls count as total success rolls while the plan is being
executed\u2014until someone rolls a failure, at which point the plan falls
apart catastrophically.

  - Night vision goggles (can see at night), +2 TACTICAL
`,`**TEACHER:** You are a wise mentor who fosters an inquisitive and confident
attitude in your pupils. You can take on any player as a pupil\u2014they
can ask the referee for one useful fact of any type, once per mission.
When you complete a mission, lose 1D6 MAX HP if you did not have a
teachable moment with every pupil.

  - Pins and medals (command respect), +2 TACTICAL
`,`**TECHNIQUE:** Your special technique targets a series of critical pressure
points. When you would deal DAMAGE, you can choose to roll 2D6 and
execute your technique instead\u2014on a 9 or below, you deal no damage.
If you roll 10 or more, the victim instantly dies.

  - Tattered gi (1 ARMOR), -1 FORCEFUL
`,`**TELEKINETIC:** You have telekinetic control over a single substance
of your choice\u2014it could be something simple like water or metal, or
something more esoteric like blood or flies. You have a unique talisman,
such as a mask or a pendant, through which you channel your power. If
this psychic amplifier is damaged or lost, you are no longer telekinetic
until you repair or replace it.

  - Psychic amplifier (accessory), +1 CREATIVE
`,`**TELEPORT:** You can teleport yourself (and any items you are wearing
or holding) to a safe location at will, but not directly through opaque
objects. If you want to teleport under fire, through an object, or beyond
the immediate perceivable area, roll +TACTICAL to avoid accidents.

  - Flare gun (1D6 DAMAGE), +2 REFLEXIVE
`,`**THEATRICS:** You command attention. When you enter a room, everyone
inside is guaranteed to look at you. When you\u2019re trying to cause a
distraction, partial successes count as full successes.

  - Sweeping cape (1 ARMOR, accessory), +1 CREATIVE
`,`**THIEF:** You may roll +REFLEXIVE to teleport an object you can perceive
into your possession. On a failure, you take something else as well\u2014the
referee will tell you what.

  - Smoke grenade (one use), +1 REFLEXIVE
`,`**THRALL:** You are bound to an anomalous artifact, a weapon which
drives you to commit evil. When you start a mission, roll 1D6 to receive
its command (1-2: Make a good person suffer. 3-4: Spread chaos and
permanent destruction. 5-6: Sabotage your teammates). Your role is
irrelevant\u2014you can only advance if you have completed this task. All
damage dealt with your anomalous weapon is increased +1D6.

  - Anomalous weapon (choose any), +1 FORCEFUL
`,`**TRAPS:** You are an expert in the art of trapping and misdirection.
Whenever you create or set a trap (e.g. covering a hole with leaves
or wiring a grenade to a doorknob), you may declare that one passing
enemy who is completely unaware of you becomes hurt or ensnared.

  - Claymore mine (2D6 DAMAGE, one use), -1 FORCEFUL
`,`**TRIPPER:** You are a psychedelics enthusiast. When you have some time
to unwind, you can drop a tab to expand your consciousness and take
+2 to your next CREATIVE roll.

  - Acid tab (one use), +1 WAR DIE per mission
`,`**TRUTH:** Through rigorous meditation and study of the natural world, you
have determined that your reality is merely a consensus illusion enjoyed
by beings from a \u201Crealer" reality as a leisurely game. Once per session,
if you have a completely serene moment to achieve lucidity, you may
speak through your \u201Cplayer" and contact the \u201Creferee" with requests
for assistance (such as HP, items, or the sudden death of your enemies).
Keep in mind that even if you are able to appeal to the referee's guilt
or curiosity to get what you want, overuse of this power may see you
branded \u201Cbroken," \u201Cgimmicky," or \u201Cunfair" by the higher beings, spelling
the end of your existence as a playable character.

  - Copy of
FIST: Ultra Edition, +2 CREATIVE
`,`**TURNCOAT:** At one point, you belonged to an enemy faction of your
choice. You no longer serve them. When you run up against this faction,
the referee will tell you something tactically important about them.

  - Enemy uniform (1 ARMOR, blend in with faction), +1 TACTICAL
`,`**TURRET:** You have a portable mini-turret which can be deployed on any
flat surface without rolling the dice. If it's somewhere difficult like a
ceiling or dangerous outcropping, placing it will be more difficult and
arduous\u2014the referee will tell you how. Your mini-turret begins with 3
MAX HP and 1 ARMOR, but you may increase its HP by 1D6 or its ARMOR
by 1 as an alternative reward when you advance. Whenever you or one
of your allies successfully deal DAMAGE, you may command the turret
to deal DAMAGE as well to any unobstructed target in the combat scene.

  - Mini-turret (1D6+TAC DAMAGE), +1 TACTICAL
`,`**UNARMED:** You are skilled in general unarmed self-defense, as well as
one or more styles of martial art. You can silently knock any enemy
unconscious, but they might make noise on the way down, or wake up
at an inconvenient time\u2014the referee will tell you the downside.

  - Hand wraps (3 DAMAGE), +1 FORCEFUL
`,`**UNDEAD:** That which should kill you only makes your rotting flesh
weaker. When you would die, lower all of your attributes by 1 and revive
next mission with full health. Each time this happens, you gain a new
aesthetic quirk, like bolts in your neck or stitched-together skin. You
may still die voluntarily.

  - Full-body bandages (1 ARMOR), -2 CREATIVE
`,`**UNFEELING:** You experience no emotional interoception, and must rely
on some other rationale to motivate your decisions under pressure.
When you would roll CREATIVE to deal with something emotional, you
may describe how you're using a different attribute and roll using that
instead, adding your inverted CREATIVE score on top (e.g. +1 if you have -1 CRE, or -2 if you have +2 CRE).

  - Brain teaser puzzle (e.g. Rubik\u2019s cube), -1 CREATIVE
`,`**VAMPIRE:** You are pale and shadowy, starved for blood. If you have
recently fed on a new victim, your next roll will be one degree of success
higher. If you are currently exposed to sunlight, all your rolls will be one
degree of success lower.

  - Gothic amulet (used to turn into a bat and back), -2 FORCEFUL
`,`**VEHICLE:** You have a customized civilian vehicle of your choice. It could
be a common vehicle like a motorcycle or pickup truck; it could be
something unique like a snowmobile or horse. You can permanently
mount any of your weapons on the vehicle, for yourself and for
secondary gunners. You can also permanently scrap any armor you
have and add it to your vehicle\u2019s armor rating. At 0 HP, the vehicle is
unusable, but you can repair 1D6 HP between missions.

  - Signature vehicle (player's choice of type), +1 TACTICAL
`,`**VENOMOUS:** You can excrete a substance (perhaps as spit, or from your
skin) that corrodes most materials and is fatal if ingested. Doing so is
unpleasant and strenuous, and pushing out large amounts (i.e. more
than a few drops, or a thin coating on a surface) will cost you 3 HP.

  - Indestructible vial (easily concealed), -1 FORCEFUL
`,`**VETERAN:** You've seen war, plenty of it, and you know in your gut where
to start looking when there's a target on your head. Whenever you enter
a new area, you can ask the referee if there is a hidden danger and get
an honest answer.

  - Assault rifle (1D6+1 DAMAGE), +1 ARMOR at all times
`,`**VOLATILE:** Your menagerie of ultrahuman abilities is virtually infinite in
scope, but which powers manifest themselves (and when) is completely
unpredictable. At the beginning of each mission, roll a trait (D666). That
trait replaces this trait (VOLATILE) until the end of the mission (although
you also retain VOLATILE's containment armor and -2 TACTICAL penalty).
Reroll your trait when you rest, use a WAR DIE, or take 6+ DAMAGE.

  - Containment armor (2 ARMOR), -2 TACTICAL
`,`**WALLBANG:** You can shoot any form of ammunition through solid matter
as though it were air. When you do so, there is a 3-in-1D6 chance that
the shot will ricochet and harm someone else (possibly yourself) instead.

  - Laser sight (attach to weapon for +1 on attack rolls), +1 REFLEXIVE
`,`**WEAPONMASTER:** At the beginning of each mission, declare a specific
type of weapon which you are currently training yourself to defend
against. It shouldn\u2019t be too vague; pick something like \u201Cbolt-action rifles\u201D
or \u201Ctwo-handed swords." If an enemy attacks you with the weapon
type you chose, their DAMAGE is cut in half, rounded down. You cannot
choose the same weapon type twice in a row.

  - Arms handbook (see enemies\u2019 DAMAGE), +1 TACTICAL
`,`**WEB:** Your web-shooters spray pressurized jets of sticky, artificial fiber
with high tensile strength and a slow-dissolving chemical makeup. You
may roll +REFLEXIVE to incapacitate anyone by wrapping them in webs,
and you may always deftly hang or swing from your webs without rolling
the dice.

  - Web-shooters (accessory), +1 REFLEXIVE
`,`**WEIGHTLIFTER:** You can always easily lift things close to your own weight.
If it\u2019s something really heavy, like a huge tank or part of a crumbling
building, there will be a complication from over-exertion\u2014the referee
will tell you what.

  - Heavy riot shield (2 ARMOR, equip as weapon), +1 FORCEFUL
`,`**WHISPERER:** You can understand the thoughts of animals, and ask
them for information or favors. They are not obligated to comply, and
may not always have the necessary context to communicate with you
effectively.

  - Fur cloak (pacifies nearby animals, accessory), +1 CREATIVE
`,`**WINNER:** You can always win low-stakes contests of skill, mettle, or
chance without rolling the dice. If it\u2019s a high-stakes game (like five-
finger fillet, Russian roulette, or an all-in poker hand), you can push
yourself to win automatically at the cost of 1D6 MAX HP.

  - Platinum chip (extremely valuable), +1 when you roll WAR DICE
`,`**WITCH:** You are a cunning practitioner of ancient magic who can cast
spells at will. Magic spells may change any single situational detail which
only you perceive at the moment of casting (such as making a shoe
untied or causing a highway exit to be missed), but may not outright
break the laws of physics. Words of magic burn the tongue, and each
spell you cast costs 1 HP. Your odd charm never returns upon use, but
you may choose to gain a new one as an advancement reward.

  - Odd charm (ignore death and fully heal, consumable), +1 CREATIVE
`,`**WITTY:** If you deliver a clever (or cheesy) one-liner that makes the other
players laugh, groan, or cheer after overcoming a particularly difficult
challenge, your HP is refilled to maximum.

  - Old sunglasses (see through disguises), +1 CREATIVE
`,`**WIZARD:** You are an arrogant meddler in the arcane otherworld, and
many mischievous sorceries have taken up residence in your head. Once
per mission, you may roll 1D6, gesture wildly, and unleash a torrent of
magic upon any target:

  1. Caster becomes a small animal for 30 minutes.
  2. Target gains magical armor which negates an attack, then shatters.
  3. Misaimed fireball which deals 2D6 DAMAGE to anyone in the way.
  4. Target completely heals.
  5. Target enters cadaverous but reversible sleep.
  6. Target and caster both disintegrate.
  
You may spend one WAR DIE to reroll the result, and spend more to
reroll as many times as you like. If you advance, you can replace one of
the 1D6 results with a new spell you and the ref agree upon, instead of
taking the usual advancement reward. The azure bolts from your magic
missile launcher are ontologically guaranteed to always hit someone\u2014
though not necessarily the intended target.

  - Magic missile launcher (1D6 DAMAGE), +2 CREATIVE
`,`**XENO:** You do not look, think, or act like a human. You are clearly an alien,
and cannot blend into groups of humans without a very good disguise.
Describe what type of alien you are\u2014other aliens of the same type will
never be hostile to you.

  - Plasma pistol (1D6 DAMAGE, or charge up for 1D6+1), +1 CREATIV
`]},kW={type:"data",filePath:"/Users/dcash/Projects/_sites/intelligence-matrix/src/content/tables/character_traits.yaml",rawData:`- |
  **ACCOUNTANT:** Financial number-crunching is your raison d'\xEAtre. You
  may identify inconsistencies in ledgers without rolling the dice, and you
  can always spot a counterfeit bill. Once per mission, you may ask the
  referee where and how a given entity is spending its money, and receive
  an honest answer (including offshore accounts, tax write-offs, and
  employee embezzlement). If you notice and correct an inconsistency
  in your FIST game, like lost HP that was never marked or a WAR DIE
  someone forgot they had, gain a WAR DIE.

    - Coffee thermos (+1D6 HP, one use), -2 CREATIVE
- |
  **ACE:** You can do tricky vehicular maneuvers, like drifting or doing a
  barrel roll, without rolling the dice. If it\u2019s something really difficult, like
  flying sideways through a small opening or riding a motorcycle across
  a tightrope, you can do it, but a key component of your vehicle will be
  destroyed\u2014the referee will tell you what. When you have downtime to
  repair it, you can use it again.

    - Fuzzy dice (gives any vehicle +2 MAX HP), +1 REFLEXIVE
- |
  **ACHILLES:** In exchange for great power, you have a terrible weakness
  to a common substance, such as salt, iron, or silver. It could also be
  something considered uncommon (like a specific mineral from space),
  but the referee will make sure it appears often enough to be a problem. If
  this substance physically touches you, you are completely incapacitated
  until you have downtime to receive medical care.

    - Substance detector (pings on proximity), +6 MAX HP
- |
  **AIMBOT:** You can only attack one target at a time. You are unable to
  engage another until your target has either left your line of fire or died.
  While attacking your target, partial successes become full ones.

    - Hand cannon (1D6+1 DAMAGE), -1 TACTICAL
- |
  **AKIMBO:** You can wield any two weapons at once, but your accuracy is
  decreased: when an attack lands, roll DAMAGE for both weapons, then
  drop one die from the total.

    - Two SMGs (1D6 DAMAGE each), +1 FORCEFUL
- |
  **AMATEUR:** You have no formalized military training. Civilians always listen
  to you and tend to trust you, but you can never pass as a soldier.

    - Civilian outfit (0 ARMOR, blend into crowds), -1 FORCEFUL
- |
  **ANALYST:** You are trained in the art of war, and your judgment in the
  field of combat analysis is impeccable. When a fight breaks out, you
  may always ask the referee for any nearby exits, as well as what tactics
  your enemies plan to use (e.g. flanking, a bum rush, or picking off the
  weak), and receive an honest answer.

    - Bolt-action rifle (1D6+1 DAMAGE), +2 TACTICAL
- |
  **ANIMUS:** Your touch grants sapience. Once per mission, you may touch
  an object or animal to give it human intelligence, movement and speech.
  Those you \u201Cawaken\u201D in this way are under no obligation to take it well.

    - Lighter (your longtime companion), +1 CREATIVE
- |
  **AQUATIC:** You\u2019re a water-breather\u2014perhaps due to spliced-on fish genes
  or cybernetic gills\u2014and you may stay submerged indefinitely with no ill
  effects. When you roll the dice to do something risky underwater, roll
  3D6 and take the best two. On land, roll 3D6 and take the worst two.

    - Heavy harpoon launcher (1D6+2 DAMAGE), +1 FORCEFUL
- |
  **ARMORED:** You are fused with a cumbersome suit of power armor that
  you cannot remove. Once per mission, you can completely ignore any
  amount of DAMAGE dealt to you.

    - Power armor (2 ARMOR, cannot be unequipped), -2 REFLEXIVE
- |
  **ARTIST:** If you have a reasonable amount of time and complete safety,
  you can create something with your art supplies and it will become real
  until the end of the mission.

    - Art supplies (one use), +2 CREATIVE
- |
  **ASSASSINATION:** Once per mission, you may instantly kill up to three weak
  enemies (3 HP or less) who are completely unaware of your presence,
  without rolling the dice. If you do not have a way of measuring an
  enemy\u2019s HP, you may have to gauge their condition based upon referee
  description.

    - Wrist blade (3 DAMAGE, does not count as equipped), +1 REFLEXIVE
- |
  **ASTRONAUT:** You have been to (or are from) outer space. When you would
  roll the dice to do something risky which involves aliens, spaceships,
  airless environments, or irregular gravity, roll 3D6 and take the best two.

    - Space suit (1 ARMOR, constant oxygen supply), -1 REFLEXIVE
- |
  **ATMOKINESIS:** You can always change the weather within a mile of
  you. Once per mission, you can make it something particularly severe/
  dangerous (tornadoes, extreme heat, freezing blizzards, etc.) Once
  changed, it\u2019s difficult to undo.

    - Lightning grenade (1D6 DAMAGE, one use), -1 TACTICAL
- |
  **AURA:** You can perceive the auras of yourself and others; their qualities
  are up to your interpretation. You may also regulate and amplify
  your aura to conduct it between bodies\u2014while doing so, NPCs who
  are touching you won\u2019t CHOKE, and anyone who remains in constant
  physical contact with you for about ten minutes regains 1D6 HP.

    - Psionic grenade (scrambles emotions, one use), +1 FORCEFUL
- |
  **BERSERKER:** For you, there are no tactics\u2014only the thrill of battle. If you
  rush into combat with no precaution or pre-planning, your first attack
  will deal double DAMAGE.

    - Minigun (1D6+2 DAMAGE), -2 TACTICAL
- |
  **BOMBER:** If you have a reasonable amount of prep time, you can use
  your bomb kit and attempt to destroy any structure by rolling +TACTICAL.
  You may also spend a WAR DIE at any time to create a small, throwable
  explosive that deals 1D6 DAMAGE.

    - Bomb kit (one use), +1 TACTICAL\\
- |
  **BOTTLENECK:** If you put yourself between something you are defending
  and a large amount of enemies, you deal +1 DAMAGE per 5 enemies
  attempting to harm you for as long as you hold your position. You may
  sacrifice yourself to ensure that an oncoming horde does not pass.

    - Antique shortsword (1D6+1 DAMAGE), -1 TACTICAL
- |
  **BOUNCE:** When you deal damage to an enemy in melee combat, they are
  tossed 1D6 \xD7 10 feet with enough force to knock them clear through a
  wall (though this deals no additional DAMAGE).

    - Kinetic gauntlet (1D6 DAMAGE), +1 FORCEFUL
- |
  **BREAKDOWN:** A directive burns in the back of your mind. When you
  take this trait, randomly roll a CHOKE score for your character (D66, p.
  148)\u2014and roll against it when appropriate, as the ref would with an NPC.
  If you CHOKE, you must either perform the listed action immediately or
  release a psionic shockwave from your skull, ten feet in diameter with
  the concussive force of a frag grenade. This shockwave deals 1D6+2
  DAMAGE to everyone caught inside (not including yourself) and, if you
  spend a WAR DIE, additionally functions as a short-range EMP burst
  which shorts out power lines, burns out lights, and disables electronics.

    - Needle gun (1D6+1 DAMAGE), -1 TACTICAL
- |
  **BUDDY:** You and another player who possesses the BUDDY trait are best
  friends. When you work together, you become an unstoppable force of
  nature, adding +1 whenever you apply a WAR DIE to your buddy\u2019s roll. If
  your buddy dies, your MAX HP is halved by grief (rounded down) until
  you dedicate a mission to delivering a special possession, such as their
  gun, their dog tags, or their favorite book, to a proper final resting place.

    - Friendship bracelet (matches another), +2 FORCEFUL
- |
  **BUILDER:** Given enough time, the right materials, and relative safety,
  you can build any common structure (guaranteed to be sound, sturdy,
  and reliable) without rolling the dice. You build things simple, solid, and
  square, so special structures and rush jobs will have complications\u2014the
  referee will tell you what.

    - Tool belt (produce any hardware store tool, one use), -1 CREATIVE
- |
  **BUM:** Years of homelessness have been harsh on your bones, but you
  are skilled in the art of survival sans income and shelter. You may roll
  the dice +CREATIVE to panhandle in the presence of enemies\u2014on a
  success, at least one enemy will give you something they have, free of
  charge. Those who ignore poor and homeless people will never notice
  you, even if you\u2019re hiding in plain sight.

    - Shabby coat (new Item (p. 85) in pocket each mission), -1 FORCEFUL
- |
  **CAMOUFLAGE:** You have an impressive collection of face paints and
  situationally-appropriate patterned fatigues, and you know how to use
  them. When you begin a mission, describe your current camo pattern,
  such as \u201Cdesert,\u201D \u201Cforest,\u201D \u201Cjungle,\u201D or \u201Curban.\u201D Take +1 to your roll
  whenever you roll to avoid detection in the corresponding environment.

    - Camouflage fatigues (multiple patterns), +2 REFLEXIVE
- |
  **CANNIBAL:** Your power grows when you feast upon human flesh. When
  you have privacy, you may dine upon any corpse and gain 1D6 HP. If you
  imply to someone that you're going to eat them, roll 1D6\u2014if the result
  is less than or equal to the amount of people you've eaten during this
  mission, they lose their nerve and capitulate or flee (referee's choice).

    - Chainsaw (1D6+1 DAMAGE), -2 CREATIVE
- |
  **CENTIPEDE:** You have a worm-like parasite living inside you. You may
  roll +FORCEFUL to bite someone. On a success, the parasite travels
  through your mouth and latches on, controlling their body. The parasite
  may then travel through the secondary body, and so on, creating a
  \u201Cchain\u201D of bodies. For each body you add to the chain, gain their HP
  and any special abilities they have, but take a cumulative -1 penalty to
  REFLEXIVE. You may release a body from the end of the chain at any
  time; they quickly regain control.

    - Muzzle (contains the centipede, accessory), +1 FORCEFUL
- |
  **CHAMPION:** You live for the righteous thrill of triumph. When you are the
  only one to survive a fight, immediately gain 2D6 MAX HP and fully heal.

    - Spear (1D6+1 DAMAGE), +1 FORCEFUL
- |
  **CHARM:** You can always manipulate people into doing what you want
  without rolling the dice, but you will have to make a significant sacrifice
  or maintain a difficult lie\u2014the referee will tell you how.

    - Combat tuxedo (1 ARMOR), +1 CREATIVE
- |
  **CHEF:** You can cook a good meal in almost any situation without rolling
  the dice. When you need to cook an exquisite meal, roll +CREATIVE and
  choose one of the following effects on a partial success, or two on a
  full success: grants +1 to any attribute for one roll, heals 1D6+CRE HP,
  pacifies and nourishes those who eat it.

    - Meat cleaver (1D6 DAMAGE), +1 WAR DIE per mission
- |
  **CHEMIST:** If you have a reasonable amount of prep time and complete
  safety, you can set up your portable lab and synthesize any common
  chemical, such as isopropyl alcohol, lighter fluid, or chloroform.
  Synthesizing esoteric or experimental compounds will require special
  supplies\u2014the referee will tell you what.

    - Portable lab (three uses), +1 TACTICAL
- |
  **CLASSY:** You are well-versed in the aesthetics, logistics, and mores of
  high society. Your name always ends up on VIP lists, and rich socialites
  tend to share gossip with you freely. Lower-class people will never trust
  you, and you struggle to hide the sticky psychic stench of wealth.

    - Diamond jewelry (quietly bribe someone, one use), +1 CREATIVE
- |
  **CLIMBER:** You can climb surfaces with hand- and footholds without
  rolling the dice, and stick to smooth surfaces by rolling +REFLEXIVE. If
  you do so during a dangerous situation, you must roll +REFLEXIVE again
  to unstick yourself without falling or getting hurt.

    - Grapple gun (50 feet of cable), +1 REFLEXIVE
- |
  **COMMANDO:** You're a real life action hero. You deal +1 DAMAGE during
  any solo fight where you are clearly outmatched, but take a -2 DAMAGE
  penalty when someone is fighting alongside you.

    - Rocket launcher (1D6+2 DAMAGE), +1 FORCEFUL
- |
  **CONCEAL:** You can always take weapons and contraband through pat-
  downs, checkpoints, and metal detectors without rolling the dice. Once
  per mission, if you have no weapon equipped and no weapons in your
  inventory, you may reveal a random weapon (roll D66 on the weapons
  table, p. 83) and say that you had it hidden away the whole time.

    - Leather trenchcoat (1 ARMOR), -1 REFLEXIVE
- |
  **CONTORTIONIST:** You can always fit through small openings and perform
  feats of flexibility without rolling the dice. If you contort yourself in
  a particularly difficult way, you've pulled something\u2014decrease your
  REFLEXIVE attribute by 2 until the end of the mission.

    - Skin-tight suit (1 ARMOR), +1 REFLEXIVE
- |
  **CRUEL:** Merely shooting, burning, or stabbing someone is never enough
  for you\u2014without fail, you always double down and twist the knife. While
  dealing DAMAGE, you may reroll any dice which show up as 1.

    - Micro-blade stiletto (1D6+RFX DAMAGE), +1 DAMAGE vs. fleeing targets
- |
  **CUT:** You can easily cut any mundane object (such as a tree, a dumpster,
  or an oil tanker) into several pieces given enough time. You may also
  instantly cut something perfectly in half, as long as you identify its
  unique fracture point by rolling 1D6 and correctly predicting the result.
  When someone damages you, and you're wielding a cutting weapon,
  you may roll DAMAGE to counter theirs. On a mismatch, they hurt you
  as usual and your damage roll means nothing, but on a tie, you are
  unscathed... and your opponent is revealed to have been cut in half.

    - Katana (1D6+1 DAMAGE), +1 REFLEXIVE
- |
  **CYBORG:** You have augmented ultrahuman agility. You can reroll one
  damage die\u2014dealing or receiving\u2014once per fight.

    - Cyborg exoskeleton (1 ARMOR), +1 REFLEXIVE
- |
  **DEBATEUR:** If you change an NPC\u2019s mind or convincingly win an argument
  against them, you may immediately deal 6 DAMAGE to them (ignoring
  armor) in a psychic attack.

    - Debate notes (use to cite inarguable statistics, one use), +1 TACTICAL
- |
  **DEFUSE:** When you would attempt to defuse a bomb or bomb-like
  device, you may open it up to reveal a mess of wires. Ask the referee to
  roll 1D6 and choose an amount of wire colors equal to the number rolled
  (the ref should choose from the following list: red, orange, yellow, green,
  blue, purple). The referee should secretly decide which wire, when cut,
  defuses the bomb, assuming that all others will detonate it. You may roll
  1D6 to receive a list of that many wire colors which are unsafe to cut. If
  you roll equal to or over the amount of wire colors, you have no idea.

    - Wire cutters (3 DAMAGE), +1 REFLEXIVE
- |
  **DETECTIVE:** At the beginning of each mission, the referee will privately
  tell you a secret, such as the identity of a killer or the truth behind a
  conspiracy. Every time you do something which produces conclusive,
  show-stopping evidence towards revealing the secret, gain a WAR DIE.

    - Notepad (provides details about someone, three uses), +1 TACTICAL
- |
  **DETONATOR:** You can explode, once. Doing so kills you, messily, destroys
  nearby structures, and deals 2D6 DAMAGE to everyone around you.

    - Bomb suit (2 ARMOR), +1 FORCEFUL
- |
  **DIRECTOR:** Once per mission, you may firmly announce, \u201CCUT!" The camera
  pulls back, revealing a set, and you may give direction to the other
  characters and NPCs as if they were actors in a movie. When ready to
  play again, say \u201CACTION!\u201D and start again from the beginning of the
  scene or fight (essentially rewinding time, allowing characters to make
  different decisions and rolls).

    - Stupid hat, +1 CREATIVE
- |
  **DIRTY:** You fight using underhanded and dishonorable methods. When
  you trick-attack an enemy, roll DAMAGE twice and take the higher result.

    - Pocket sand (+1 to attack rolls vs. sand victim, one use), +1 FORCEFUL
- |
  **DISGUISE:** You can disguise yourself as anyone as long as you have a
  reasonable amount of prep time; however, your cover will be blown if
  you either speak, move quickly, or get hurt\u2014the referee decides which.

    - Bulletproof vest (1 ARMOR), +1 TACTICAL
- |
  **DOORS:** When you enter through a door, you may emerge through any
  other door you have encountered. You have a method for pushing
  through locked/barricaded doors (like lockpicks, bombs, or a heavy
  boot) that works every time, but always has an inconvenient downside\u2014
  the referee will tell you what.

    - Keyring (3 DAMAGE), +1 FORCEFUL
- |
  **DRUID:** You are a philosopher of science and prophecy. If an eligible
  sacrifice is at hand, you may observe the trajectory and resulting
  patterns of its spilled blood for a simple yes-or-no answer to any
  question, however complicated.

    - Psychoactive herb (cures a psionic ailment, one use), +1 TACTICAL
- |
  **DUELIST:** You deal +1 DAMAGE during a fair fight with a single opponent.
  You deal another +1 DAMAGE if you attempt to intimidate, taunt, or
  seduce that opponent.

    - Laser katana (1D6+2 DAMAGE), +1 DAMAGE with melee weapons
- |
  **ECHO:** You can create 1D6 shadow-clones of yourself at will. Doing so
  stretches you thin, and costs you HP equal to the amount summoned.
  The clones appear incorporeal, but can physically affect the world as you
  can. Each clone has MAX HP equal to your MAX HP minus the number of
  clones, does not think or feel, and behaves roughly as you behave.

    - Quantum duplicator (copies any object, one use), +2 MAX HP
- |
  **EMPATHY:** You can sense how anyone is feeling without rolling the dice.
  Whenever you do something risky to prevent needless pain and death,
  roll 3D6 and take the best two. Any time you do something violent or
  harmful, roll 3D6 and take the worst two.

    - Invisibility cloak (room for two people), -1 FORCEFUL
- |
  **EXPERT:** Your encyclopedic knowledge of a scientific discipline exceeds
  professional and borders on obsessive. When you take this trait, choose
  an \u201C-ology,\u201D such as sociology, entomology, or cryptozoology. When you
  roll the dice to do something risky related to your field of expertise, roll
  3D6 and take the best two.

    - Textbook (answer any field-related question, one use), -1 CREATIVE
- |
  **FASHIONABLE:** You may combine multiple pieces of body-sized armor
  and wear them all at once to gain their cumulative ARMOR score, if you
  can convincingly explain how they work together as a cohesive outfit.

    - Leather jacket (1 ARMOR), -2 REFLEXIVE
- |
  **FATALITY:** Once per mission, you may describe the creative and brutal
  finishing move you perform on an enemy with less than 3 HP (if you do
  not have a way of measuring an enemy\u2019s HP, you may have to gauge
  their condition based upon referee description). Once you\u2019ve performed
  your finisher, the enemy is permanently killed and cannot be revived by
  any means.

    - Kunai chain (1D6 DAMAGE), -1 TACTICAL
- |
  **FATE:** You are able to manipulate the threads of chance, perhaps through
  careful study of reality\u2019s emergent properties or by some connection
  to the divine. When you would roll a WAR DIE, roll two instead and use
  either one as your result. If you roll doubles, use both.

    - Loaded dice (difficult to detect), -2 TACTICAL
- |
  **FIELD:** Once per mission, you may project a bubble of solid psionic force
  ten feet in diameter which is centered on you and provides anyone
  inside 3 ARMOR against outside attacks. If you roll the dice +CREATIVE,
  you may attempt to fashion the field into a different shape. Failing this
  roll or getting hurt while projecting the field immediately dissipates it.

    - Paint gun (clearly marks a surface or area), +2 FORCEFUL
- |
  **FIEND:** You utilize amphetamines to enhance your focus. When you have
  a second free, you can pop some pills and take +2 to your next TACTICAL
  roll.

    - Pill bottle (one use), +1 WAR DIE per mission
- |
  **FIGHTER:** Your study of hand-to-hand, the basis of all combat, has
  made your body itself into a lethal weapon. You may choose to deal 1D6
  DAMAGE when attacking with no weapon equipped. Once per mission,
  you may launch a special, unarmed super attack which deals 1D6+2
  DAMAGE and knocks most living things unconscious. When you do,
  state the name of your super attack.

    - Flashy outfit (1 ARMOR), +1 FORCEFUL
- |
  **FIREFIGHTER:** You are professionally trained to fight fires (or you are a
  seasoned volunteer). Once per mission, you may entirely put out any
  fire which has spread no further than the confines of a single structure
  (particularly large or nasty fires may keep you occupied for a while). Add
  +2 whenever you roll the dice to do something risky while navigating a
  burning or collapsing environment.

    - Hydro-gun with backpack tank (3 DAMAGE, 55 gal.), -1 REFLEXIVE
- |
  **FLIGHT:** You have the ability to fly, perhaps using wings, a jetpack, or
  telekinetic levitation. If you take damage while in the air, you must roll
  +REFLEXIVE to avoid a dangerous fall or collision with something nearby.

    - AR goggles (let you see enemies\u2019 HP), +1 TACTICAL
- |
  **FLOW:** You live in the moment and can be like water, moving with the
  currents of reality. Whenever you roll a failure, mark down a plus sign\u2014
  you can have up to three. When you do something risky, you can spend
  any amount of plus signs to add that much to your roll.

    - Staff (1D6 DAMAGE, 3-in-1D6 chance to knockout), -2 TACTICAL
- |
  **FLURRY:** Once per mission, you may enter a \u201Cflurry state\u201D during combat.
  In your flurry state, you may choose to instantly roll DAMAGE against
  anyone who hurts you; doing so ends the state. When you leave your
  flurry state, take 1D6 DAMAGE from overexertion.

    - Energy drink (+1D6 HP, one use), +2 REFLEXIVE
- |
  **FOCUS:** When you have a moment of utter tranquility to rest and digest
  the day\u2019s events (like a drink at an empty bar or a gorgeous view), gain
  a WAR DIE. You lose this WAR DIE if you fail to use it during this mission.

    - Stress ball (squeeze for +1 to any WAR DIE roll), -1 CREATIVE
- |
  **FORAGE:** When you have some prep time, you can ask the referee about
  the local flora and fauna. If you present a convincing reason why one of
  these things could work for the ailment you\u2019re trying to treat, you may
  heal yourself or someone else for 1D6 HP.

    - Machete (1D6 DAMAGE), +1 TACTICAL
- |
  **FREEZE:** Once per mission, you may freeze time for ten minutes and move
  around freely. You may not harm or otherwise alter any living things (as
  this would cause a superposition-collapse cascade), but you can do
  anything else that fits in the span of ten minutes, such as constructing
  a barricade, moving to a different location, or taking a short rest. To
  outside observers, you will look like a blur, and your actions will appear
  to have happened almost instantly. Your stasis grenade creates a zone
  of frozen time ten feet in diameter which stops anything that enters it.

    - Stasis grenade (ten minute duration, one use), -1 TACTICAL
- |
  **GADGETS:** You always carry a treasure trove of bulky, delicate electronics.
  If you have space to work, you can use your electronics kit to create a
  device (equivalent in function to a trait-granted item of your choice), or
  a robot (has a trait of your choice, 1 HP, and 1 ARMOR).

    - Electronics kit (three uses), -2 REFLEXIVE
- |
  **GANGSTER:** You are part of an organized crime group such as a mafia
  syndicate, a yakuza clan, a cartel, or a triad. The referee will always
  tell you where to find illegal items. You can intimidate enemies without
  rolling, but cops and law-abiding civilians will always mistrust you.

    - Silencer (attach to any gun), +1 FORCEFUL
- |
  **GENIUS:** You\u2019re really smart. You have to make sure everyone else knows
  it. Whenever you correct someone, especially on something pedantic
  (and you\u2019re actually right), heal 1 HP.

    - Glasses (you can\u2019t see without them), +2 TACTICAL
- |
  **GOONS:** You begin each mission accompanied by 1D6 disposable goons.
  Each goon comes with 3 MAX HP and all standard issue items. You
  can roll +TACTICAL to command your goons. They tend to misinterpret
  commands, shoot themselves in the foot (figuratively or literally), and
  often make bizarre non-sequitur decisions under pressure.

    - Walkie-talkie (summons goons to your position), +1 TACTICAL
- |
  **GROUND:** You know how to cut through the noise, for better or for worse.
  Once per mission, you may plant yourself firmly and beckon your team
  to \u201Cform up\u201D on you. If they do, mark the occasion with a firm gesture
  (like pointing forward or reloading your shotgun), and choose a bonus
  to activate for the next ten minutes: everyone in the area adds +2 to
  their DAMAGE dealt and adds +2 when rolling to do something risky, or
  all anomalous abilities and phenomena in the area are nullified.

    - Pump-action shotgun (1D6+1 DAMAGE), -1 CREATIVE
- |
  **GROW:** You may double your size at will, as long as your spatial manipulator
  belt is intact. Each time you do, increase your MAX HP by 1D6 (and gain
  that much HP), increase your FORCEFUL score by 1, and decrease your
  REFLEXIVE score by 1. While enlarged, you may also add your current HP
  to any unarmed or melee DAMAGE you deal.

    - Spatial manipulator belt (accessory), -2 MAX HP
- |
  **HACKER:** If you have a reasonable amount of prep time and direct access,
  you can attempt to gain control of any computer or electronic machine
  by rolling the dice +TACTICAL. If you do not have direct access, you can
  attempt to hack in from a safe place using your briefcase computer.

    - Briefcase computer (remotely access electronics), +1 TACTICAL
- |
  **HAPPY:** You don\u2019t let anything get you down. You have +1 on all rolls
  to make a person or situation happier (but not necessarily better). If
  you ask the referee \u201CWhat does this character enjoy?\u201D, they will always
  answer truthfully.

    - Bundle of lollipops (heal 1 HP, three uses), -1 FORCEFUL
- |
  **HARVEST:** When you would deal a killing blow with a melee weapon, you
  may roll 1D6 to attempt to harvest an internal organ before death\u2014on a
  4 or above, consume it, and choose to a) gain a WAR DIE, or b) heal for
  1D6 HP. On a 3 or below, your killing blow doesn\u2019t land.

    - Bloody axe (1D6 DAMAGE), +1 REFLEXIVE
- |
  **HATE:** Something about you just rubs people the wrong way, and you
  don\u2019t mind that at all. When you meet someone, roll +CREATIVE\u2014on
  anything but a success, they hate or strongly dislike you. When you
  attack someone because you truly hate them\u2014not just for money, or
  because they were a threat, but because you hate them, and you can
  explain why\u2014they will be absolutely obliterated, HP notwithstanding.

    - Bubblegum (funny comic included), -1 CREATIVE
- |
  **HAZARD:** You are unusually hardy when faced with toxins and pathogens.
  Once per mission, you may expose yourself to a hazardous substance
  and either a) suffer no ill effects at all, or b) receive a useful fact from
  the referee about the substance\u2019s effects, nature, or origin.

    - Gas mask (ignore breathing-based damage), +1 FORCEFUL
- |
  **HEADSPACE:** You walk softly among the myriad glimmering beauties and
  horrors of the subconscious mind made manifest. Once per mission, you
  (and anyone physically touching you) may leap into the subconscious of
  a thinking being and explore it as a physical space, complete with objects,
  flora, fauna, and in some cases enemies. Even the slightest alteration
  to this physicalized headspace can have rippling consequences on the
  gestalt consciousness above, so it is imperative that any psychonaut
  be deliberate and controlled during their expedition into thought.

    - Psycho-recorder (makes a mind backup tape, one use), -2 FORCEFUL
- |
  **HEAVYWEIGHT:** You can tear through most inanimate obstacles with
  ease. If it\u2019s something really tough, like solid concrete or metal, it will be
  more difficult and complicated\u2014the referee will explain how.

    - Break-action shotgun (1D6+1 DAMAGE), +1 FORCEFUL
- |
  **HENSHIN:** Using your device, you can take on another form. This alternate
  form has 1D6 HP (reroll each time) and starts with one additional trait. If
  you reach 0 HP while transformed, you\u2019re knocked out for a few minutes,
  revert to normal, and can\u2019t transform again until the next mission.

    - Mystery device (wearable), -1 to ARMOR in normal form
- |
  **HEX:** You can place any being under a hex, depriving them of good luck.
  For as long as you hold someone in your web of tainted fate, something
  of your choice always goes wrong\u2014guns always jam, vehicles always
  fail to start, etc. Until you break the hex, it applies to you as well.

    - Ritual dagger (1D6 DAMAGE, double vs. divine beings), +1 CREATIVE
- |
  **HIGHLANDER:** When you kill someone important, you may gain a trait,
  but not the associated stat bonus or item, based on any special abilities
  they may have. The referee decides who is important.

    - Ancient longsword (1D6+1 DAMAGE), +1 FORCEFUL
- |
  **HIJACK:** You can take control of any occupied vehicle and toss aside its
  operator without rolling the dice, as long as the operator is exposed. For
  closed and/or armored vehicles, the process of hijacking will be more
  difficult and complicated\u2014the referee will tell you how.

    - Hotwiring kit (hotwire any inert vehicle, one use), +1 FORCEFUL
- |
  **HOLY:** You may be a god, an angel, a pious believer, or a power-drunk
  zealot\u2014whatever your relationship is to the divine, choose a conceptual
  domain to which you belong (such as balance, love, or war). Once
  per mission, you may trace a holy circle upon the ground (ten feet
  in diameter), over which all things antithetical to your domain cannot
  cross. The referee has the final say on which things are truly antithetical,
  unless you spend one WAR DIE to preach over them.

    - Bow of solid light (1D6+CRE DAMAGE), +1 DAMAGE vs. antithetical
- |
  **HUNTER:** You can track anything that leaves a trail, as though the ability
  were instinctual. When you find it, you can roll +TACTICAL to observe it
  without detection.

    - Compound bow (1D6 damage, silent), +1 TACTICAL
- |
  **HYBRID:** You are genetically spliced with an animal of your choice. You
  gain +1 to an attribute that you and the referee agree makes sense for
  your animal (+1 FORCEFUL for a shark, +1 REFLEXIVE for a hummingbird,
  etc.). Animals of the same type will always see you as one of their own,
  and tend towards trusting anyone you're with. Unfortunately, all worn
  armor is 1 point less effective due to its incorrect fit.

    - Animal feed (+1D6 HP, one use), +1 to chosen attribute
- |
  **HYPNOSIS:** Your sustained state of self-hypnosis maximizes efficiency,
  but requires a suspended sense of self. Any time you do something risky
  while hypnotized, you can reroll one die (keeping lower results). If you
  muster any sentiment, your hypnosis ends for the rest of the mission.

    - Nutrient slurry (+2D6 HP, one use), -2 CREATIVE
- |
  **ICEBREAKER:** You know how to get the party started. When you land
  the first strike in a fight, gain a WAR DIE and deal double DAMAGE. Take
  double DAMAGE whenever you are struck by an unexpected attack.

    - Tactical battleaxe (1D6+1 DAMAGE), +2 FORCEFUL
- |
  **ILLUSION:** If you're free to gesture, you can attempt to manipulate another
  person into hallucinating anything of your choice by rolling +CREATIVE.
  Rolling higher creates a more believable illusion, and illusions born of lower
  rolls may be influenced by the contents of the victim's psyche.

    - Whip (1D6 DAMAGE), +1 CREATIVE
- |
  **IMPROVISE:** You can improvise a weapon from two or more common
  objects to instantly kill a single enemy once per mission. You can
  always create this makeshift weapon discreetly and quickly, even while
  restrained or otherwise incapacitated, without rolling the dice.

    - Slingshot (3 DAMAGE), +1 CREATIVE
- |
  **INJECTION:** You are addicted to an experimental serum that increases
  your combat ability. During combat, you can inject and deal double
  damage until the fight is won. Each time you inject, decrease your MAX
  HP by 3. At the end of a mission, your MAX HP returns to its normal
  amount.

    - Automatic injection suit (2 ARMOR), -1 REFLEXIVE
- |
  **INSURANCE:** When you take this trait, write your \u201Cwill.\u201D Your will may
  be modified, but only once per mission. If you die permanently, your
  traits (not including this one), skill modifiers (positive and negative),
  and items are distributed to other characters according to your will.

    - Briefcase full of cash (a small fortune), +1 to chosen attribute
- |
  **INTERROGATION:** You can lock an unsuspecting enemy in a chokehold
  and ask them one question, which they will always answer truthfully
  before trying to escape.

    - Combat knife (1D6 DAMAGE), +1 FORCEFUL
- |
  **JANITOR:** You can clean up any mess in minutes and always have the
  supplies on hand to do so. If someone interrupts your cleaning or makes
  the mess worse, you have +2 on DAMAGE rolls against them.

    - Mop (3 DAMAGE), +1 FORCEFUL
- |
  **JINX:** Bad luck has followed you for your entire life. Once per mission,
  you can say \u201CI feel like something really bad is about to happen\u201D or an
  equivalent phrase, and it does. It will be bad for you and all nearby
  characters. The resulting catastrophe completely interrupts the scene
  and can cancel incoming damage, disorient enemies, etc.

    - Mirror (break to reroll any roll and take the lower result), +1D6 MAX HP
- |
  **JOKER:** You never take anything too seriously. If you choose to do
  something risky not because it is right or good, but because it would
  be funny (and everyone playing agrees), roll 3D6 and take the best two.

    - Joke pistol (shoots \u201CBANG!\u201D flag), -2 TACTICAL
- |
  **KNIGHT:** You follow a strict code of honor and unquestioningly serve a
  powerful person or organization of your choice (note that FIST is not a
  powerful organization). You deal +1 DAMAGE if you have not yet broken
  your code of honor during a mission. Your role is irrelevant: you can only
  advance by increasing the wealth, power, or status of those you serve.
  Should your superiors die, your role becomes WANDERER.

    - Medieval helmet (1 ARMOR, accessory), -1 CREATIVE
- |
  **LIMBS:** You have many appendages (additional arms, spider-like legs,
  tentacles, etc.) When you are attempting to catch something or grapple
  someone, roll twice and take the best result.

    - Many knives (1D6+1 DAMAGE), +1 REFLEXIVE
- |
  **LIMIT:** When pushed to the brink of your capacity for punishment, you
  unlock new wells of power. If you have already fulfilled your role during
  the course of a mission and your HP is equal to 1, you may immediately
  advance now, instead of when the mission ends.

    - Mercury-core executioner\u2019s sword (1D6+FRC DAMAGE), +2 MAX HP
- |
  **LINK:** Touching someone\u2019s skin bonds their soul to yours. When you take
  damage, they take the same amount and vice versa. You may speak
  telepathically and share each other\u2019s senses (one at a time).

    - Thick gloves (must be removed to establish link), +1 REFLEXIVE
- |
  **LISTEN:** You have incredibly sensitive and specific hearing, but a
  tumultuous relationship with the rest of your senses. You may always
  perfectly eavesdrop on conversations, listen for tell-tale sounds, and
  approximate the locations of things you can\u2019t see without rolling the
  dice, but loud noises, bright lights, strong smells, grating textures, and
  intense tastes all deal 1 DAMAGE when you are first exposed to them.

    - Blindfold (helps you focus), +2 REFLEXIVE
- |
  **LOVER:** If you and another player both have this trait, you can choose,
  together, to become lovers. If you rescued your lover from the brink of
  death during the mission, you both gain 1 WAR DIE at the end. There is
  no limit to how many lovers you can have, but if a lover of yours dies,
  your character can no longer gain new traits when advancing.

    - Silver handgun (1D6 damage, double vs. undead), +1 ARMOR when
  protecting others
- |
  **LUSH:** You prefer to fight at least half in the bag. When you have some
  free time, you can tip back your liquor bottle and take +2 to your next
  FORCEFUL roll.

    - Liquor bottle (one use), +1 WAR DIE per mission
- |
  **LYCANTHROPE:** At night, you transform and gain the HYBRID trait (but
  not the associated item). If you have transformed during a mission, your
  role becomes irrelevant, and you can only advance by fulfilling a specific
  animal desire\u2014roll 1D6 to let it wash over you (1-2: Challenge yourself as
  hunter or prey, 3-4: Consume the lifeforce of several human beings, 5-6:
  Stage a grand sacrifice to the gods of the Moon).

    - Handcuffs (titanium-reinforced), +6 MAX HP in animal form
- |
  **MASCOT:** You are the beautifully fragile glue which bolsters the team\u2019s
  spirit and binds them together. Your MAX HP is irrelevant\u2014for the
  purposes of play, it is always equal to 1. As long as you are alive, your
  remaining MAX HP is divided as evenly as possible and added onto the
  MAX HP of every other player (e.g. a 6 MAX HP MASCOT in a four-player
  team grants 1, 2, and 2 MAX HP to the other three players).

    - Extravagant costume (draws enemy fire), -2 FORCEFUL
- |
  **MECHANIC:** With a reasonable amount of prep time, you can use your
  toolbox to repair any machine for 1D6+TACTICAL HP.

    - Toolbox (repair 1D6+TAC HP, three uses), +1 TACTICAL
- |
  **MEDIC:** With a reasonable amount of prep time, you can use your medkit to
  heal any ailment. For other healing items, add your TAC to the HP regained.

    - Medkit (heal 1D6+TAC HP, three uses), +1 TACTICAL
- |
  **MERCY:** When you would deal a killing blow to a non-player character,
  you may choose to instead approach them, help them up, and show
  them mercy. Characters who have been shown your mercy can never
  take DAMAGE again, and will always treat you (but not necessarily
  anyone else) as a trustworthy and reliable friend.

    - Halo (make someone change their ways, one use), -1 FORCEFUL
- |
  **MIMIC:** You can shapeshift, but only into inanimate objects. Once per
  mission, you may transform into a single item no larger than a car. If you
  transform into a tool, machine, etc., you are fully functional and may be
  used as such by others.

    - Varnish (+1D6 HP while mimic, one use), +2 MAX HP
- |
  **MINDREADER:** You can read anyone\u2019s thoughts and general state of mind
  without rolling. You may roll +CREATIVE to scan for specific information,
  such as names, passwords, memories, and images. Unfortunately, you
  are particularly susceptible to interference, and the thoughts of others
  often cloud your psyche. Your mindreading ability is neutralized in the
  presence of another mindreader, and vice versa.

    - X-ray specs (see through walls), -1 CREATIVE
- |
  **MOBILITY:** Your customized mobility aid (e.g. a titanium cane with
  spring-loaded feet, or a wheelchair with adaptive tank treads) is tricked
  out with additional gadgets and features. Choose one of the following
  add-ons, active when you're using the aid: 1) +1 to an attribute of your
  choice, 2) an always-concealable weapon that deals 1D6 DAMAGE, or 3)
  +1 to your ARMOR. If you roll the dice to do something risky that would
  normally involve your mobility aid, but you don't have access to it, roll
  3D6 and take the worst two. When you advance, you can get another
  add-on instead of taking one of the usual advancement rewards.

    - Mobility aid (comes with an add-on), +1 REFLEXIVE
- |
  **MOMENTUM:** You are able to enter a state of cumulative momentum at
  will, harnessing inertia to your advantage. Each time you succeed on
  a REFLEXIVE roll, gain +1 REFLEXIVE. This bonus accumulates until you
  stop moving, at which point your REFLEXIVE attribute reverts back to
  normal. Rolling a failure with a cumulative bonus from this trait will incur
  DAMAGE equal to the bonus, and cause you to stop moving.

    - Rail-grinding boots (grind on any edge), +1 REFLEXIVE
- |
  **MONOLOGUE:** When you give an impassioned ethical, political, or
  philosophical speech, roll +CREATIVE. On a partial success, you engage
  your target in the melodramatic speech, temporarily distracting them.
  On a full success, they see your line of reasoning and make an effort to
  join your school of thought.

    - Yorick\u2019s skull prop (very realistic), +2 CREATIVE
- |
  **MONSTERS:** Once per mission, you may use your computerized monster
  index to summon and command a monster from the barcode of any
  real-life object you have with you. Arrange the numbers in the barcode
  from lowest to highest and derive your monster's stats as follows:
  DAMAGE equal to 1D6 + the lowest number, HP equal to the highest
  number, and ARMOR equal to the middle number (if there are two,
  split the difference and round down). State and record the monster's
  appearance and name, and work out a special power with the referee
  that reflects the origin object (e.g. belches of flame from a bottle of hot
  sauce or answering any one question from a library card).

    - Monster index (hold aloft to summon a monster), -1 REFLEXIVE
- |
  **MORBID:** You have some kind of relationship with death. Describe how,
  and what form death takes. If you or another character dies, you can
  call death to your side. Death will give you some task or challenge and
  a time limit, then the dead character is healed by 1D6. If you don\u2019t
  complete the task within the time limit, death takes you both.

    - Gifted scythe (2D6 DAMAGE), -2 MAX HP
- |
  **MURDER:** You\u2019re followed by a heckling murder of crows that spout
  various ominous phrases (some helpful). The crows circle when someone
  is soon to die, foreshadowing danger. You may command the crows to
  circle around an enemy, who takes +1 DAMAGE from all sources until the
  crows get bored and leave.

    - Birdseed (guarantee a helpful omen, one use), +1 TACTICAL
- |
  **MUTANT:** You are a picture of evolution in microcosm, always changing
  form as your unstable genome shifts. At the beginning of each mission,
  roll 1D6. On a 4+, drop any one trait you already have (except MUTANT),
  and permanently replace it with another, recalculating your attributes.

    - Toxic grenade (1D6+2 damage, one use), -1 TACTICAL
- |
  **NEUROMANCER:** Given a few hours in a quiet place, you can remove
  brains from their bodies and put them in new ones. Body transplantation
  is not a perfect science, and those who have undergone the process
  may not always come back the same.

    - Brain jar (keeps one brain alive), +1 CREATIVE
- |
  **NINJA:** Due to your training in the dark arts of subterfuge, any acrobatic
  or athletic action you take will always be completely silent, even when
  you roll failures. You may choose your current ninja weapon at the
  beginning of each mission: shuriken (1D6 DAMAGE), kunai (3 DAMAGE,
  usable for climbing), or smoke bomb (temporarily disorient 1D6 targets).

    - Ninja weapon (six uses), +1 REFLEXIVE
- |
  **NOIR:** You\u2019re from the old days, when crime ran the streets, the cigarettes
  were plentiful, and hard work meant something. You gain +1 on rolls you
  provide an appropriate monologue for.

    - Trench coat (1 ARMOR), +1 FORCEFUL
- |
  **NUMBERS:** All numbers have meaning. At the beginning of each mission,
  roll 1D6. Once per mission, you may replace any number with the number
  rolled. This can be another roll (such as damage) or a number-based
  fact spoken by the referee (five enemies, ten days, six stars, etc.)

    - Sudoku workbook (keep someone occupied, one use), +1 TACTICAL
- |
  **OBJECTS:** You may attack with any non-weapon object within reach\u2014if
  you describe a unique, creative way of causing harm with this object, it
  functions as a weapon which deals 1D6 DAMAGE. Subsequent objects
  you attack with add a cumulative +1 DAMAGE bonus per new object;
  this cumulative bonus resets to 0 when you roll a failure, reuse an attack
  description, or switch to a conventional weapon.

    - Leather belt (3 DAMAGE), +1 CREATIVE
- |
  **OOZE:** You can transform into a gelatinous substance at will. While in
  your gelatinous form, you have -2 REFLEXIVE and -2 FORCEFUL, but you
  can squeeze through grates, fit inside containers, and split into pieces.

    - Bucket (5 gallon), +1 REFLEXIVE
- |
  **PAINLESS:** You cannot feel pain, and being hurt will never cause you to
  flinch or stop what you\u2019re doing. At the beginning of each mission, the
  referee will roll 1D6 and keep the result hidden from you. The first time
  you reach 0 HP during the mission, you will regain HP equal to the result.

    - Wrist and ankle weights (1 ARMOR, accessory), -2 REFLEXIVE
- |
  **PARKOUR:** You can easily swing, jump, and free-run across rooftops and
  rafters without rolling the dice. If it\u2019s something really precarious, like
  barrels floating in toxic waste or a rope bridge full of people shooting
  at you, you can still do it, but you\u2019ll drop one of your items in an
  inconvenient spot\u2014the referee decides what, and where.

    - Baseball bat (1D6 DAMAGE), +1 REFLEXIVE
- |
  **PATHETIC:** You are entirely unintimidating and almost universally pitied.
  Enemies often underestimate you. Once per mission, before you take
  damage, you may look into an enemy\u2019s eyes and nullify it.

    - Box of tissues (hides a pistol inside, 1D6 DAMAGE), -1 FORCEFUL
- |
  **PET:** You have a small pet (1-3 HP, referee's choice) which you always
  keep on your person\u2014perhaps in a shirt pocket, on your shoulder, or
  leashed to your belt. Describe your pet and choose a bonus for them:
  1) grants 1 ARMOR and functions as an accessory, 2) grants +1 to an
  attribute of your choice for a single roll when fed a treat, 3) deals 3
  DAMAGE to an enemy when fed a treat. If your pet dies, you can start
  the next mission with a new one, but not with the same bonus as before.

    - Pet treats (three uses), -1 REFLEXIVE
- |
  **PHONE:** You may make telepathic \u201Ccalls\u201D to anyone regardless of time,
  distance, or interdimensional status\u2014these calls may be routed through
  local telephones and radios, or may simply appear as a disembodied
  voice. Those you call are not guaranteed to answer. Sometimes, you\u2019ll
  receive calls you\u2019d prefer not to.

    - Rolodex (3 strange and important people are listed), +1 CREATIVE
- |
  **PIRATE:** You're a free spirit who prefers a life of spontaneous adventure
  on the high seas. Whenever you roll the dice to do something risky
  involving the ocean, stealing, or taking over a crewed vessel, roll 3D6
  and take the best two.

    - Illegally modified LMG (1D6+2 DAMAGE), -1 TACTICAL
- |
  **POCKET:** You can fit pretty much anything into your personal pocket
  dimension (and retrieve it at will) as long as you are not restrained or
  particularly distracted. Your pocket-space might be accessed through a
  bottomless bag, a door that follows you between rooms, or a wormhole
  you can summon with a wish.

    - Refrigerator (well-stocked), -1 REFLEXIVE
- |
  **POLYGLOT:** You can understand and communicate in any mundane
  language, written or verbal. You can also roll +TACTICAL to understand
  languages which are supernatural in origin.

    - Universal phrasebook (can teach anyone one phrase), +1 CREATIVE
- |
  **PRECOGNITION:** Once per mission, before you roll the dice to do something
  risky, you may declare a state of precognition\u2014have everyone mark
  down where they are, their HP and items, and any other useful notes to
  capture the current situation. Roll the dice and continue play as normal.
  Next time you're prompted to roll the dice, decide if what's happened
  was your destined path, or in fact a mere possible future\u2014if so, rewind
  the story using everyone's notes, keeping in mind that small distortions
  in reality are a normal consequence of precognitive radiation.

    - Stopwatch (waterproof), -2 TACTICAL
- |
  **PREPPER:** You are perpetually awaiting the moment when the world goes
  to shit. When each mission starts, choose a specific survival skill you\u2019ve
  been practicing (e.g. knot-tying, finding water, or securing shelter).
  Add +2 whenever you roll the dice to do something risky involving your
  current survival skill, and gain an additional +1 HP whenever you heal
  from eating MREs or other non-perishables.

    - Hatchet (3 DAMAGE), +1 TACTICAL
- |
  **PROJECTION:** You can project your spirit from your body to access any
  faraway place remotely, as long as your physical body is safe. You can
  also cheat death and keep 1 HP once per mission by abandoning your
  body, but you will be stuck in spirit form until it gets medical attention.

    - Flowing garment (1 ARMOR), +1 CREATIVE
- |
  **PROSTHETIC:** One of your limbs is replaced with any weapon you own,
  and you can equip another weapon to use. When you roll the maximum
  damage possible with an equipped weapon, you can roll damage again
  with your limb-weapon for an extra powerful combo attack.

    - Light machine gun (1D6+1 DAMAGE), -1 REFLEXIVE
- |
  **PSYCHOMETRY:** Once per mission, you can ask any inanimate object
  you are touching a psychic question. Objects will answer truthfully, but
  are limited by their experience\u2014a photograph cannot comprehend the
  passage of time, and a gun can only think in terms of killing.

    - Scrapbook (contains one mission-relevant photo), +1 CREATIVE
- |
  **PUNCTUAL:** You always know what time it is, down to the second. When
  you need to get to a time-sensitive event, appointment, or meeting, you
  will always get there in the nick of time. If arriving on time is particularly
  unlikely, the referee will tell you in what way you are unprepared for it
  when you get there.

    - Gold stopwatch (always works), +1 REFLEXIVE
- |
  **PUPPETMASTER:** You can implant a command in someone\u2019s brain by
  rolling the dice +FORCEFUL. If you succeed, they are forced to comply.

    - Strappy leather harness (1 ARMOR), +1 FORCEFUL
- |
  **PYROMANIAC:** If there is something flammable nearby, you can always
  ignite it, but the fire will uncontrollably spread somewhere inconvenient\u2014
  the referee will tell you where.

    - Flamethrower (1D6+2 DAMAGE), +2 FORCEFUL
- |
  **QUANTUM:** If another player\u2019s character dies, you may rewind time to
  shortly before their death and permanently swap characters with them,
  giving you a second chance to save their life. Swapping back into a
  body you\u2019ve inhabited before kills the one you\u2019re leaving.

    - Quantum stabilizer suit (2 ARMOR), +1 CREATIVE
- |
  **QUILLS:** You are covered in quills, spines, or thorns. When an enemy
  deals damage to you in melee combat, they take 1 DAMAGE in return. In
  addition, you may shoot the spines out of your body for 1D6 DAMAGE
  to everyone in the area, though you\u2019ll need a day to grow them back.

    - Ripped jacket (1 ARMOR), +2 MAX HP
- |
  **RADIOACTIVE:** When you aren\u2019t wearing your treated bandages, radiation
  bursts forth from your body and deals 2D6 DAMAGE to anyone near
  you. When this occurs, you may attempt to direct the attack at a single
  target by rolling +FORCEFUL. After the damage is dealt, the radiation
  temporarily dissipates, but you will quickly waste away and die if your
  treated bandages are not reapplied.

    - Treated bandages (accessory), -2 FORCEFUL
- |
  **RAGE:** Whenever you do something risky that\u2019s loud, bloody, and violent,
  roll 3D6 and take the best two. Any other time you do something risky,
  roll 3D6 and take the worst two. Enemies who you hurt have a 1 in 6
  chance of immediately attempting to flee the scene.

    - Ultra-shotgun (2D6 DAMAGE), -1 CREATIVE
- |
  **RECRUIT:** If you bring an unconscious enemy back to base with you at
  the end of a mission, you may take them with you on future missions as
  another character you control. Recruits retain their currently equipped
  weapon and armor and may have up to one trait, decided by the referee.
  Recruits start with 1D6 MAX HP and gain 3 MAX HP for each mission
  they complete alongside you.

    - Tranq pistol (0 DAMAGE, 3-in-1D6 chance to knockout), +1 CREATIVE
- |
  **RELOAD:** When you\u2019re about to attack with a ranged weapon, you can
  choose to dig in your heels, slam in another mag, and unload a whole
  clip. You will deal double DAMAGE, but any damage you take until finding
  cover will also be doubled.

    - Grenade (1D6 DAMAGE, one use), +1 REFLEXIVE
- |
  **RETREAT:** You have a place in your head (a cozy cabin, a crystal palace,
  a concrete cell, etc.) that you can manifest physically. Once per mission,
  you may roll +CREATIVE to transport yourself and up to four other people
  there. The specifics of the retreat may be changed at will, resting there
  heals 1D6 HP, and you or your guests may leave at any time.

    - Polaroid camera (for memories), +1 CREATIVE
- |
  **RIVAL:** Choose any other player to be your rival. Each time you
  spectacularly one-up or humiliate your rival, heal 1D6 HP. If your rival
  thoroughly one-ups you, you lose any WAR DICE you have. When you
  take this trait, you gain a new aesthetic feature, like a streak of dyed
  hair, an eyepatch, or a cool scar.

    - Carbine (1D6 DAMAGE), +1 DAMAGE when showing off
- |
  **ROBOT:** You are a man-made automaton bound by your rigid programming.
  When you take this trait, select another player to be your programmer
  (or allow all of the players to program you democratically). When a
  mission begins, your programmer(s) should define a three-word core
  directive for you to follow, such as \u201CELIMINATE ALL HOSTILES," \u201CSEARCH
  NEW AREAS," or \u201CPROTECT THE TEAM." Your programmer(s) should also
  select a broad concept which \u201Cdoes not compute," such as love, music,
  or peace. When you roll the dice to do something risky while acting
  on your core directive, roll 3D6 and take the best two. When you are
  exposed to something which does not compute, drop what you're
  doing and shut down for ten minutes, or take 1D6 DAMAGE.

    - Laser rifle (1D6+1 DAMAGE), -1 CREATIVE
- |
  **RUNNER:** You possess ultrahuman speed. Once per mission, you may
  outpace someone or something. If it\u2019s something really fast, like a
  hunting cheetah or a flying bullet, there will be a complication from
  over-exertion\u2014the referee will tell you what.

    - Experimental sneakers (indestructible), +1 REFLEXIVE
- |
  **SAWBONES:** You\u2019re a doctor, but you don\u2019t have a medical license. Once
  per mission, when a player character dies, you can roll +CREATIVE to
  perform surgery and resurrect them with full health. You must swap out
  one of their traits for a new one as part of your experimental surgery,
  and explain why your operation changed their trait.

    - Bone saw (1D6+1 DAMAGE), -2 MAX HP
- |
  **SCAVENGER:** You understand that everything can be repurposed and
  that nothing need go to waste. If the referee narrates that you've run
  out of a finite resource (like ammo, medicine, or food), you may spend
  a WAR DIE and roll it to negate the referee and reveal your backup
  reserves, equal to the result rolled (e.g. 2 clips of ammo, 4 doses of
  antivenom, or 6 MREs). You always gain a WAR DIE at rendezvous points.

    - Semi-automatic rifle (1D6+1 DAMAGE), +1 TACTICAL
- |
  **SCOUT:** You always get the lay of the land before starting a mission. You
  can find a good vantage point or hiding place anywhere, any time. The
  referee will always tell you about ambushes and hidden traps.

    - Ghillie suit (disguise self as plant), +1 TACTICAL
- |
  **SEAL:** You are a living lock for the cage of something horrible (you don\u2019t
  know what). You have complex tattoos and carvings across your entire
  body. If you die before the appointed time (also unknown), you release
  whatever you\u2019re holding back into the world.

    - Wards and charms (accessory), +1 REFLEXIVE
- |
  **SECURITY:** If you have a reasonable amount of prep time and the coast
  is clear, you can use your anti-security kit and attempt to breach any
  lock or crack any safe by rolling +REFLEXIVE. You may also disarm traps
  you know about and can physically reach by rolling +TACTICAL.

    - Anti-security kit (three uses), +1 REFLEXIVE
- |
  **SEDUCE:** When someone wants to get with you, you can fade to black
  and get with them too. After you return from a nearby private retreat,
  roll +CREATIVE and choose one result on a partial success, or two on a
  full success: they want to help you, they trust you with their secrets,
  or they want to get with you again. On a failure, you're old news, and
  they'll dislike your company from now on.

    - Little black dress (0 ARMOR, stand out anywhere), +1 CREATIVE
- |
  **SEER:** When you have a moment of peace and quiet, you may read your
  divination tool (perhaps a deck of playing cards or a set of polyhedral
  dice) and roll +CREATIVE. If you succeed, the referee will answer one
  question about the current mission honestly. If it\u2019s a partial success,
  they\u2019ll answer vaguely. A failure brings a grim and terrible omen.

    - Divination tool, +1 CREATIVE
- |
  **SEXY:** You\u2019re so hot, and everyone knows it, you most of all. When
  you\u2019re wearing your fetching outfit, you can stun another person with
  your beauty without rolling the dice. If you take damage in the outfit,
  you have to stay out of the fight until it\u2019s over to attend to chipped
  nails, untucked shirts, and messed up hairdos.

    - Fetching outfit (0 ARMOR), -1 REFLEXIVE
- |
  **SHARPSHOOTER:** If you name a specific body part, possession, or
  component of something you\u2019re attacking with a ranged weapon, you
  will always hit it, temporarily disabling that part but dealing 0 DAMAGE.

    - Revolver (1D6+1 DAMAGE), +1 REFLEXIVE
- |
  **SHIELD:** You can use any shield as a weapon which bashes enemies for
  1D6 DAMAGE plus the shield\u2019s ARMOR bonus. If you throw the shield as
  a ranged weapon, you can roll +REFLEXIVE to ricochet it back to you.

    - Combat shield (0 ARMOR, accessory), +1 FORCEFUL
- |
  **SHOW:** Your performance art (perhaps music, dance, acrobatics, or
  comedy) has inexplicable mind-altering effects on its audience. While
  performing, choose one of the following: your allies have +1 to an
  attribute of your choice, enemies are dazed (they deal -1 DAMAGE), or
  one enemy gives in to fun. You take -1 to any rolls made while performing.

    - Performing accoutrement (e.g. instrument, baton, mic), +1 CREATIVE
- |
  **SHRINK:** Your unique atomic structure allows you to compress yourself
  down to a millimeter tall without rolling the dice. If you go smaller, you
  must roll +TACTICAL to avoid slipping through a hole in the quantum foam.
  Those who slip through the foam suffer mind-bending consequences,
  like becoming marooned or losing their sense of time (referee's call).

    - Stainless steel syringe (contains a miniature submarine), +2 MAX HP
- |
  **SKELETON:** You have no flesh\u2014explain why. You have 2 ARMOR against
  weapons that pierce or slash, and take +1 DAMAGE from weapons that
  bludgeon. If you reach 0 HP but all your bones are intact, you may rise
  with 1 HP after someone else completely reassembles you.

    - Ownerless femur (1D6 DAMAGE), -2 FORCEFUL
- |
  **SLACKER:** You abide by the universe in all things and appreciate simple
  pleasures. In addition to the single rendezvous point all player characters
  can use, you may always access an additional, second rendezvous
  point which is typically easy to reach and additionally contains snacks,
  substances, a hammock, or similar amenities.

    - Shabby clothes (0 ARMOR, always unthreatening), -1 TACTICAL
- |
  **SLEEPER:** Your personality is but a programmed front to hide the
  dormant sleeper agent beneath (or maybe it\u2019s the other way around).
  When you take this trait, everyone at the table but you should come
  to a consensus on what your activation phrase is (like \u201Cthe woman
  in white walks backwards through Prague,\u201D or \u201CEpsilon orange Manila
  seventeen\u201D). Once it\u2019s decided, write it down, and create a new, second
  FIST character who shares none of your traits\u2014this is your sleeper
  persona (if you have already advanced, advance the persona an equal
  number of times, but do not choose the same advancement options).
  Any time you hear your activation phrase, you swap between personas,
  but the items in your inventory do not change to match your traits until
  you start a new mission.

    - Tape recorder (plays activation phrase), -1 CREATIVE
- |
  **SLOW-MO:** You may slow time to a crawl (at a 1-to-1 seconds-to-minutes
  ratio) at will, turning volleys of gunfire into glittering armadas of hot
  lead ships. Doing so costs you 1 HP for every second of time you slow.
  Slow-time affects your actions and physical processes but does not
  change the speed of your thoughts, giving you lightning-fast cognition
  relative to those around you. During slowed time, your REFLEXIVE score
  is increased by 4.

    - Machine pistol (1D6 DAMAGE), -2 REFLEXIVE
- |
  **SMASH:** You break things. You deal +1 DAMAGE against any man-made
  construct, and another +1 DAMAGE against anything that is grossly
  expensive or has exquisitely fragile components.

    - Sledgehammer (1D6+1 DAMAGE), +1 FORCEFUL
- |
  **SMITH:** You may deploy your portable workbench once per mission to
  add a new effect to an existing weapon (you can choose a premade
  weapon tag or negotiate a custom effect with the referee). The effect
  will be successfully added if you leave the weapon at the workbench,
  acquire three integral but difficult-to-reach components, and return to
  combine the components and weapon. The referee will tell you what
  and where the components are; they are usually scattered throughout
  the mission area. You may also employ a similar process of deploying
  your workbench and collecting materials to forge new pieces of armor.

    - Portable workbench (one use), +1 TACTICAL
- |
  **SMOKER:** You are addicted to nicotine. When you have some downtime,
  you can calm your nerves with a cigarette and take +2 to your next
  REFLEXIVE roll.

    - Cigarette case (one use), +1 WAR DIE per mission
- |
  **SNATCHER:** You are an alien poorly puppeteering a technically dead
  human body, with a killing touch. If you do not consume one human
  brain without anyone finding out once per mission, you will melt into a
  puddle and die.

    - Poison fingertips (2D6 damage, don't count as equipped), -2 CREATIVE
- |
  **SNEAK:** If you hold still in a good hiding spot, no one will detect you
  until you make your presence known. You can also easily fit into small
  containers like barrels and cardboard boxes.

    - Sneaking suit (1 ARMOR), +1 REFLEXIVE
- |
  **SNIPER:** If you have prep time, the enemy is unaware of your presence,
  and you remain stationary, you can roll 3D6 to attack and use the best
  two dice. If you succeed, you deal the maximum possible DAMAGE for
  your weapon.

    - Sniper rifle (1D6+2 DAMAGE), +1 DAMAGE with ranged weapons
- |
  **SOAK:** You know how to grin and bear it. When you take damage, you
  may roll a WAR DIE and subtract that much from the DAMAGE taken. You
  may also apply this effect to anyone standing immediately behind you.

    - Kinetic shock shield (2 ARMOR, equip as weapon), -2 REFLEXIVE
- |
  **SOCIAL:** You have a likable personality and a familiar face. Take +1 to your
  roll whenever you do something risky that involves a social interaction.

    - Cyanide pill (one use), +1 CREATIVE
- |
  **SPY:** You are a dashing and clever international person of mystery. Major
  antagonists tend to behave in contrived and theatrical ways around
  you. If you are captured, you may ask the referee to give you an easy
  opportunity to escape and they will give it to you.

    - Laser watch (3 DAMAGE, can cut any restraints), +1 TACTICAL
- |
  **STAND:** You command a flamboyant spirit with its own trait, tangible
  only to you but able to affect the corporeal world. Roll a random trait
  for your stand (D666) and choose a hyper-specific additional bonus,
  like \u201Ccan be used twice per mission if my blood is removed and replaced\u201D
  or \u201Cdeals double DAMAGE if the target is left-handed.\u201D Everyone else at
  the table should democratically decide on a hyper-specific condition or
  downside, such as \u201Ccan only be used when Mercury is in retrograde\u201D or
  \u201Ccauses a random bone in the user\u2019s body to break when used.\u201D

    - Stand (immortal and invisible), +1 FORCEFUL
- |
  **STATIC:** You can enter and travel between electronic screens of any kind
  as long as the screen isn\u2019t too \u201Cbusy\u201D (plain backgrounds and static
  work best).

    - Chaff grenade (disables electronics, one use), +1 REFLEXIVE
- |
  **STATUESQUE:** You\u2019re made of something hard (stone, metal, gems, etc.)
  Once per mission, you can reflect any projectile back at the attacker. If
  you are also wearing armor, decrease your REFLEXIVE score by 2.

    - Tough exterior (2 ARMOR, doesn't count as equipped), +1 FORCEFUL
- |
  **STICKY:** You can secrete a sticky substance from your body which
  dries in seconds and is comparable in strength to the most powerful
  mundane adhesives. It can only be dissolved with a common substance
  of your choice (water, alcohol, blood, etc.)

    - Flask of dissolving fluid (8 ounces), -1 REFLEXIVE
- |
  **STONER:** You function much better while high. When you have the time,
  you can enjoy your favorite strain using any method of your choice.
  State the name of the strain (e.g. \u201CGreen Giant" or \u201CNuclear Winter"),
  and choose a bonus: +1D6 HP, or +2 to your next roll.

    - Personal stash (one use), +1 WAR DIE per mission
- |
  **STRETCH:** You can stretch any of your limbs to a length of ten feet \xD7
  your MAX HP by rolling the dice +REFLEXIVE. Stretched out limbs can be
  pushed even further, but will incur 1 DAMAGE for every additional ten
  feet of stretch. You take +1 DAMAGE when enemies specifically target
  stretched-out limbs.

    - Elastic bodysuit (0 ARMOR, up to 1000 sq. ft. of fabric), -1 FORCEFUL
- |
  **STUBBORN:** You're one tough son of a bitch, and not even God can keep
  you down for long. When you roll a failure and the referee narrates what
  happens next, you can spend a WAR DIE and declare that it doesn't,
  forcing the referee to narrate an entirely different failure outcome
  instead.

    - Special cigar (+1D6 HP, one use), -2 CREATIVE

  **SUMMONER:** You know the deepest, truest names of two phantasmagoric
  entities (demons, elementals, Platonic ideals, etc.) and their domains of
  power (such as grief, fire, or logic). You can summon them via fire-circle
  with ten minutes of unbroken ritual, or instantly by spending a WAR DIE.
  Each of these spirits will carry out a single magical command related
  to their domain of power before vanishing, and tend towards bad-faith
  or misguided interpretations of vaguely worded instructions. Magical
  attacks from summoned spirits deal 2D6 DAMAGE, and double DAMAGE
  if their domain is well-suited to the attack (like fire against ice, or silver
  against werewolves). When you advance, you may add another spirit to
  your roster instead of taking one of the usual advancement rewards.

    - Box of tea lights (one circle's worth, one use), +1 CREATIVE
- |
  **SUNDER:** Using your psionic powers, you may sunder the mind of anyone
  you presently perceive, dealing 1D6 DAMAGE which ignores ARMOR. You
  may roll additional six-sided dice and add them to the total DAMAGE
  at will. Opening a psionic channel strains your body (perhaps causing
  nosebleeds, shaking, or confusion), and you will always take DAMAGE
  equal to half of what you deal, rounded down.

    - Grippy socks (prevent you from slipping), -2 FORCEFUL
- |
  **SUPPLY:** You know secret frequencies and can use your radio to get
  any item delivered in a pinch; however, there will be a catch, like an
  inconvenient pickup spot or a fault with the item\u2014the referee decides.

    - Supply radio (three uses), +1 TACTICAL
- |
  **SURVEILLANCE:** You can install your camera drone somewhere stationary
  and surveil without detection. You can also keep it mobile and control
  it at will, but it will be exposed to enemy attacks.

    - Camera drone (1 HP, one use), +1 TACTICAL
- |
  **SYMBIOTE:** You\u2019re bonded to a violent symbiotic lifeform with whom
  you share a tumultuous and intimate relationship. The constant
  commentary by a chorus of alien voices makes it difficult to hold on to
  your thoughts or focus on tasks. Your role is irrelevant\u2014you can only
  advance by following the whims of the creature (roll D6, 1-2: Trust no
  one, not even for a moment, 3-4: Destroy something important, 5-6:
  Backstab a teammate before they backstab you).

    - In-vivo symbiote (+2 ARMOR vs. attacks from behind), -1 TACTICAL
- |
  **SYNTHETIC:** You are a human-like android. Your positronic brain can
  make thousands of calculations per second, and you never have to roll
  the dice for tasks like solving equations and calculating trajectories.
  You take 1D6 DAMAGE when your innards are exposed to water.

    - Infantry-scale railgun (1D6+2 DAMAGE), +1 TACTICAL
- |
  **TACTICIAN:** If you explain an elaborate plan of action to the team, all
  partial success rolls count as total success rolls while the plan is being
  executed\u2014until someone rolls a failure, at which point the plan falls
  apart catastrophically.

    - Night vision goggles (can see at night), +2 TACTICAL
- |
  **TEACHER:** You are a wise mentor who fosters an inquisitive and confident
  attitude in your pupils. You can take on any player as a pupil\u2014they
  can ask the referee for one useful fact of any type, once per mission.
  When you complete a mission, lose 1D6 MAX HP if you did not have a
  teachable moment with every pupil.

    - Pins and medals (command respect), +2 TACTICAL
- |
  **TECHNIQUE:** Your special technique targets a series of critical pressure
  points. When you would deal DAMAGE, you can choose to roll 2D6 and
  execute your technique instead\u2014on a 9 or below, you deal no damage.
  If you roll 10 or more, the victim instantly dies.

    - Tattered gi (1 ARMOR), -1 FORCEFUL
- |
  **TELEKINETIC:** You have telekinetic control over a single substance
  of your choice\u2014it could be something simple like water or metal, or
  something more esoteric like blood or flies. You have a unique talisman,
  such as a mask or a pendant, through which you channel your power. If
  this psychic amplifier is damaged or lost, you are no longer telekinetic
  until you repair or replace it.

    - Psychic amplifier (accessory), +1 CREATIVE
- |
  **TELEPORT:** You can teleport yourself (and any items you are wearing
  or holding) to a safe location at will, but not directly through opaque
  objects. If you want to teleport under fire, through an object, or beyond
  the immediate perceivable area, roll +TACTICAL to avoid accidents.

    - Flare gun (1D6 DAMAGE), +2 REFLEXIVE
- |
  **THEATRICS:** You command attention. When you enter a room, everyone
  inside is guaranteed to look at you. When you\u2019re trying to cause a
  distraction, partial successes count as full successes.

    - Sweeping cape (1 ARMOR, accessory), +1 CREATIVE
- |
  **THIEF:** You may roll +REFLEXIVE to teleport an object you can perceive
  into your possession. On a failure, you take something else as well\u2014the
  referee will tell you what.

    - Smoke grenade (one use), +1 REFLEXIVE
- |
  **THRALL:** You are bound to an anomalous artifact, a weapon which
  drives you to commit evil. When you start a mission, roll 1D6 to receive
  its command (1-2: Make a good person suffer. 3-4: Spread chaos and
  permanent destruction. 5-6: Sabotage your teammates). Your role is
  irrelevant\u2014you can only advance if you have completed this task. All
  damage dealt with your anomalous weapon is increased +1D6.

    - Anomalous weapon (choose any), +1 FORCEFUL
- |
  **TRAPS:** You are an expert in the art of trapping and misdirection.
  Whenever you create or set a trap (e.g. covering a hole with leaves
  or wiring a grenade to a doorknob), you may declare that one passing
  enemy who is completely unaware of you becomes hurt or ensnared.

    - Claymore mine (2D6 DAMAGE, one use), -1 FORCEFUL
- |
  **TRIPPER:** You are a psychedelics enthusiast. When you have some time
  to unwind, you can drop a tab to expand your consciousness and take
  +2 to your next CREATIVE roll.

    - Acid tab (one use), +1 WAR DIE per mission
- |
  **TRUTH:** Through rigorous meditation and study of the natural world, you
  have determined that your reality is merely a consensus illusion enjoyed
  by beings from a \u201Crealer" reality as a leisurely game. Once per session,
  if you have a completely serene moment to achieve lucidity, you may
  speak through your \u201Cplayer" and contact the \u201Creferee" with requests
  for assistance (such as HP, items, or the sudden death of your enemies).
  Keep in mind that even if you are able to appeal to the referee's guilt
  or curiosity to get what you want, overuse of this power may see you
  branded \u201Cbroken," \u201Cgimmicky," or \u201Cunfair" by the higher beings, spelling
  the end of your existence as a playable character.

    - Copy of
  FIST: Ultra Edition, +2 CREATIVE
- |
  **TURNCOAT:** At one point, you belonged to an enemy faction of your
  choice. You no longer serve them. When you run up against this faction,
  the referee will tell you something tactically important about them.

    - Enemy uniform (1 ARMOR, blend in with faction), +1 TACTICAL
- |
  **TURRET:** You have a portable mini-turret which can be deployed on any
  flat surface without rolling the dice. If it's somewhere difficult like a
  ceiling or dangerous outcropping, placing it will be more difficult and
  arduous\u2014the referee will tell you how. Your mini-turret begins with 3
  MAX HP and 1 ARMOR, but you may increase its HP by 1D6 or its ARMOR
  by 1 as an alternative reward when you advance. Whenever you or one
  of your allies successfully deal DAMAGE, you may command the turret
  to deal DAMAGE as well to any unobstructed target in the combat scene.

    - Mini-turret (1D6+TAC DAMAGE), +1 TACTICAL
- |
  **UNARMED:** You are skilled in general unarmed self-defense, as well as
  one or more styles of martial art. You can silently knock any enemy
  unconscious, but they might make noise on the way down, or wake up
  at an inconvenient time\u2014the referee will tell you the downside.

    - Hand wraps (3 DAMAGE), +1 FORCEFUL
- |
  **UNDEAD:** That which should kill you only makes your rotting flesh
  weaker. When you would die, lower all of your attributes by 1 and revive
  next mission with full health. Each time this happens, you gain a new
  aesthetic quirk, like bolts in your neck or stitched-together skin. You
  may still die voluntarily.

    - Full-body bandages (1 ARMOR), -2 CREATIVE
- |
  **UNFEELING:** You experience no emotional interoception, and must rely
  on some other rationale to motivate your decisions under pressure.
  When you would roll CREATIVE to deal with something emotional, you
  may describe how you're using a different attribute and roll using that
  instead, adding your inverted CREATIVE score on top (e.g. +1 if you have -1 CRE, or -2 if you have +2 CRE).

    - Brain teaser puzzle (e.g. Rubik\u2019s cube), -1 CREATIVE
- |
  **VAMPIRE:** You are pale and shadowy, starved for blood. If you have
  recently fed on a new victim, your next roll will be one degree of success
  higher. If you are currently exposed to sunlight, all your rolls will be one
  degree of success lower.

    - Gothic amulet (used to turn into a bat and back), -2 FORCEFUL
- |
  **VEHICLE:** You have a customized civilian vehicle of your choice. It could
  be a common vehicle like a motorcycle or pickup truck; it could be
  something unique like a snowmobile or horse. You can permanently
  mount any of your weapons on the vehicle, for yourself and for
  secondary gunners. You can also permanently scrap any armor you
  have and add it to your vehicle\u2019s armor rating. At 0 HP, the vehicle is
  unusable, but you can repair 1D6 HP between missions.

    - Signature vehicle (player's choice of type), +1 TACTICAL
- |
  **VENOMOUS:** You can excrete a substance (perhaps as spit, or from your
  skin) that corrodes most materials and is fatal if ingested. Doing so is
  unpleasant and strenuous, and pushing out large amounts (i.e. more
  than a few drops, or a thin coating on a surface) will cost you 3 HP.

    - Indestructible vial (easily concealed), -1 FORCEFUL
- |
  **VETERAN:** You've seen war, plenty of it, and you know in your gut where
  to start looking when there's a target on your head. Whenever you enter
  a new area, you can ask the referee if there is a hidden danger and get
  an honest answer.

    - Assault rifle (1D6+1 DAMAGE), +1 ARMOR at all times
- |
  **VOLATILE:** Your menagerie of ultrahuman abilities is virtually infinite in
  scope, but which powers manifest themselves (and when) is completely
  unpredictable. At the beginning of each mission, roll a trait (D666). That
  trait replaces this trait (VOLATILE) until the end of the mission (although
  you also retain VOLATILE's containment armor and -2 TACTICAL penalty).
  Reroll your trait when you rest, use a WAR DIE, or take 6+ DAMAGE.

    - Containment armor (2 ARMOR), -2 TACTICAL
- |
  **WALLBANG:** You can shoot any form of ammunition through solid matter
  as though it were air. When you do so, there is a 3-in-1D6 chance that
  the shot will ricochet and harm someone else (possibly yourself) instead.

    - Laser sight (attach to weapon for +1 on attack rolls), +1 REFLEXIVE
- |
  **WEAPONMASTER:** At the beginning of each mission, declare a specific
  type of weapon which you are currently training yourself to defend
  against. It shouldn\u2019t be too vague; pick something like \u201Cbolt-action rifles\u201D
  or \u201Ctwo-handed swords." If an enemy attacks you with the weapon
  type you chose, their DAMAGE is cut in half, rounded down. You cannot
  choose the same weapon type twice in a row.

    - Arms handbook (see enemies\u2019 DAMAGE), +1 TACTICAL
- |
  **WEB:** Your web-shooters spray pressurized jets of sticky, artificial fiber
  with high tensile strength and a slow-dissolving chemical makeup. You
  may roll +REFLEXIVE to incapacitate anyone by wrapping them in webs,
  and you may always deftly hang or swing from your webs without rolling
  the dice.

    - Web-shooters (accessory), +1 REFLEXIVE
- |
  **WEIGHTLIFTER:** You can always easily lift things close to your own weight.
  If it\u2019s something really heavy, like a huge tank or part of a crumbling
  building, there will be a complication from over-exertion\u2014the referee
  will tell you what.

    - Heavy riot shield (2 ARMOR, equip as weapon), +1 FORCEFUL
- |
  **WHISPERER:** You can understand the thoughts of animals, and ask
  them for information or favors. They are not obligated to comply, and
  may not always have the necessary context to communicate with you
  effectively.

    - Fur cloak (pacifies nearby animals, accessory), +1 CREATIVE
- |
  **WINNER:** You can always win low-stakes contests of skill, mettle, or
  chance without rolling the dice. If it\u2019s a high-stakes game (like five-
  finger fillet, Russian roulette, or an all-in poker hand), you can push
  yourself to win automatically at the cost of 1D6 MAX HP.

    - Platinum chip (extremely valuable), +1 when you roll WAR DICE
- |
  **WITCH:** You are a cunning practitioner of ancient magic who can cast
  spells at will. Magic spells may change any single situational detail which
  only you perceive at the moment of casting (such as making a shoe
  untied or causing a highway exit to be missed), but may not outright
  break the laws of physics. Words of magic burn the tongue, and each
  spell you cast costs 1 HP. Your odd charm never returns upon use, but
  you may choose to gain a new one as an advancement reward.

    - Odd charm (ignore death and fully heal, consumable), +1 CREATIVE
- |
  **WITTY:** If you deliver a clever (or cheesy) one-liner that makes the other
  players laugh, groan, or cheer after overcoming a particularly difficult
  challenge, your HP is refilled to maximum.

    - Old sunglasses (see through disguises), +1 CREATIVE
- |
  **WIZARD:** You are an arrogant meddler in the arcane otherworld, and
  many mischievous sorceries have taken up residence in your head. Once
  per mission, you may roll 1D6, gesture wildly, and unleash a torrent of
  magic upon any target:
  
    1. Caster becomes a small animal for 30 minutes.
    2. Target gains magical armor which negates an attack, then shatters.
    3. Misaimed fireball which deals 2D6 DAMAGE to anyone in the way.
    4. Target completely heals.
    5. Target enters cadaverous but reversible sleep.
    6. Target and caster both disintegrate.
    
  You may spend one WAR DIE to reroll the result, and spend more to
  reroll as many times as you like. If you advance, you can replace one of
  the 1D6 results with a new spell you and the ref agree upon, instead of
  taking the usual advancement reward. The azure bolts from your magic
  missile launcher are ontologically guaranteed to always hit someone\u2014
  though not necessarily the intended target.

    - Magic missile launcher (1D6 DAMAGE), +2 CREATIVE
- |
  **XENO:** You do not look, think, or act like a human. You are clearly an alien,
  and cannot blend into groups of humans without a very good disguise.
  Describe what type of alien you are\u2014other aliens of the same type will
  never be hostile to you.

    - Plasma pistol (1D6 DAMAGE, or charge up for 1D6+1), +1 CREATIV`}});var uy={};_(uy,{_internal:()=>DW,collection:()=>SW,data:()=>CW,id:()=>xW});var xW,SW,CW,DW,dy=w(()=>{"use strict";xW="choke_scores",SW="tables",CW={distribution:"uniform",items:["CHOKE 1: Battle fugue state","CHOKE 1: Bribe anyone in charge","CHOKE 1: Cry profusely","CHOKE 1: Collapse elegantly","CHOKE 1: Pass out cold","CHOKE 1: Start running, don\u2019t stop","CHOKE 2: Become light-headed","CHOKE 2: Cower in cover","CHOKE 2: Defer to underling","CHOKE 2: Find an exit","CHOKE 2: Fling weapon","CHOKE 2: Hide any injuries","CHOKE 3: Blissful denial","CHOKE 3: Freeze up","CHOKE 3: Go feral","CHOKE 3: Hands-up surrender","CHOKE 3: Interfere with a player","CHOKE 3: Suddenly masochist","CHOKE 4: Behave sadistically","CHOKE 4: Break weapon showing off","CHOKE 4: Create a diversion","CHOKE 4: Get hopelessly lost","CHOKE 4: Frantic laughter","CHOKE 4: Plead for mercy","CHOKE 5: Break into song","CHOKE 5: Give up entirely","CHOKE 5: Shoot self in foot","CHOKE 5: Throw someone under the bus","CHOKE 5: Tear off shirt and howl","CHOKE 5: Trip on shoelaces","CHOKE 6: Cardiac arrest","CHOKE 6: Major joint dislocation","CHOKE 6: Self-sacrifice attack","CHOKE 6: Start hurling accusations","CHOKE 6: Turn on FIST","CHOKE 6: Ultrahuman abilities activate"]},DW={type:"data",filePath:"/Users/dcash/Projects/_sites/intelligence-matrix/src/content/tables/choke_scores.yaml",rawData:`- "CHOKE 1: Battle fugue state"
