- A grave has been dug but nobody's inside
- A modest grave marked by flowers and toys
- A single, shuffling zombie soldier, unresponsive
- A skeleton in camo clutching a whiskey bottle
- A spattering of blood and spare ammo
- A tilted flag marks the spot of a loss
- A warrior fallen upon a bayonet or sword
- A wooden cross with scratched-out dog tags
- Body in a foxhole wielding an impressive weapon
- Boots with feet still in them, bucket of grenades
- Bruised corpse with a severely broken neck
- Case of untreated venom spread, unpleasant
- Cleaned-out outpost with empty vehicles
- Creatively stacked collection of skulls
- Decaying body, gold coins spilling from pockets
- Disorganized bones aside a dusty old novel
- Gaunt corpse clutching a stash of stimulants
- Gravestone that wishes good health and luck
- Grinning natural mummy with a gut wound
- Grisly suicide, shotgun trigger pulled with toe
- Hanged soldiers swaying in the breeze
- Head on a pike with a dreadful expression
- Mangled skeleton shoved somewhere unusual
- Nine simply marked graves in a perfect square
- Peaceful natural mummy curled up with a pipe
- People in uniform stacked beneath a bloody tarp
- Person mauled by something vicious
- Rotting skeleton hunched over an unsent letter
- Scattered tongues, fingers, and eyes, radioactive
- Several poor souls strung up on meat hooks
- Shocked soldier with a clean hole in the forehead
- Smoking pile of ash haunted by a ghost
- Something has absolutely dissected a human
- Unfortunate wanderer died to the elements
- Unmitigated devastation, bodies litter the area
- "Very fresh corpse (1-in-1D6: Not actually dead)"
