- A nowhere highway dive bar
- A wide tranquil grassy plain
- Across the tracks in a subway tunnel
- An unremarkable alley in the slums
- At a church or temple service
- Atop an oddly shaped mountain
- Behind a diner, where people smoke
- Beyond the fence of a labor camp
- Blocking a rural road or highway
- College campus on a party night
- Corner bed in a dreary hostel
- Deep in the heart of the jungle
- Disturbing highland herders
- Fleeing from a ramshackle barn
- From the end of a shadowed pier
- Halogen-lit hospital halls
- High school halls on a summer night
- Hovering around ancient ruins
- In a cold shaft of gas station light
- Inside a car left unattended
- Living in someone's walls
- Lurking in an abandoned train car
- Leering outside an Arctic base
- Moving about in a warehouse
- Museum floor right before closing
- Observing a famous monument
- On the wing of a commercial jet
- Reported by a military encampment
- Some seedy harbor during bad weather
- Stalking apartment complex halls
- That part of the woods no one visits
- The confines of a prison cell
- The dark center of a quiet cornfield
- The moonlit empty desert
- The wild beyond a small village
- Third shift on a factory floor
